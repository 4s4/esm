  #{"The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study provides an analysis of Uganda’s recent economic and trade performance, and it outlines recommendations in order to increase its integration into the world trading system and mainstream good trade policies into national policy-making. In particular the study deals with sub-sector specific as well as economy-wide issues. Among the latter ones, it focuses on power generation, transport and trade facilitation, access to finance, trade policies, regional trade agreements, customs procedures, trade and export development institutions, and sanitary, phyto-sanitary and other standards. Furthermore, the study analyzes Uganda’s access to export markets, concentrating in particular on the European Union and on the potential worldwide developments following the Doha Round.

The five main strategic objectives are: 1) increasing productivity; 2) improving quality of product; 3) promoting the sales of UEMOA cotton products within the region and abroad; 4) promoting the transformation and update of the production chain; 5) promoting the development of the cotton-seed value chain. The document provides a detailed analysis of the cotton value chain in the UEMOA countries, and it outlines the future prospects of the world cotton market. In addition, it sets a precise framework for the implementation of the strategy." "The document provides an overview of the current political, economic and social context of the region, setting the regional strategic objectives and identifying the key challenges and opportunities. The strategy rotates around two pillars: regional infrastructure and capacity building; and it focuses on areas such as regional transport/trade facilitation infrastructure, regional Energy Development, information and communication technology, support to the CES Tripartite Arrangement, institutional strengthening, trade and transport facilitation and aid for trade.

"The United Nations Development Assistance Framework analyses the current social and economic situation in Armenia, focusing on demography, health systems, education, social protection, gender, governance and capacity development, human rights, environment and disaster management and risk reduction. Hence, it focuses on four main results, namely: 1) Inclusive and sustainable growth is promoted by reducing disparities and expanding economic opportunities for vulnerable groups; 2) Democratic governance is strengthened by improving accountability, promoting institutional and capacity development and expanding people’s participation; 3) Access and quality of social services is improved especially for vulnerable groups; 4) Environment and disaster risk reduction is integrated into national and local development frameworks."})
