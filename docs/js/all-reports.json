Given this scenario, the NES identifies the following main objectives: 1) to increase and sustain productivity and competitiveness of the export sector of Sri Lanka; 2) to promote the production of goods and services with greater added value and higher quality; 3) to generate a culture of exports in the country; 4) to contribute to the country’s social and economic development.

The action plan for implementation follows the thematic areas outlined by the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.","typeId":"7aeb3a89-407c-4654-8c45-64602467e881","lastUpdate":"01 Feb 2013","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2004-2015","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"3fb9591c-8267-450f-a27d-0c67540a03f7","title":"Diagnostic Trade Integration Study - Central African Republic","countryId":"d37b1038-b22c-43e3-ab77-1276fd9ecadd","sectorIds":["6a339fcc-f819-4056-8f05-9e3473191e06","2403af10-fa09-4ba6-9d19-4b6bc0dfab33","724fa0de-e1f3-4597-968e-eddd6688a548"],"year":"2007","description":"The DTIS analyses current Central African Republic\u0027s economic situation with focus on private sector development, investment climate, trade policy and institutions, regional trade agreements, market access, transport system, trade facilitation and key sub-sectoral issues.","typeId":"7aeb3a89-407c-4654-8c45-64602467e881","lastUpdate":"10 Jan 2013","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2007-2015","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"3a13e23a-9a72-4d31-bb21-0ca6bc306f7a","title":"Private Sector Assesment Report","countryId":"8d1d79fe-cddf-4bd4-8469-6c1a8eb36cf2","sectorIds":[],"year":"2013","description":"Under construction","typeId":null,"lastUpdate":"02 Feb 2016","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"-","thematicFocus":[]},{"id":"082fd7d3-8473-496e-82c7-0cd603928422","title":"National Initiative for Social Development","countryId":"e4a987d8-b5f1-45e3-bef6-ccb1563c5ffe","sectorIds":[],"year":"2008","description":"The strategy evaluates the implementation of the previous PRSP during the period 2004-2006 and it sets the basic pillars of the 2008-2011 strategy, namely: 1) accelearte growth and preserve the major macroeconomic balances; 2) develop human resources and ensure universal access to basic services; 3) promote harmonious balanced local development and preserve the environment; 4) anchor the principles of good governance and build capacities.","typeId":"7aeb3a89-407c-4654-8c45-64602467e881","lastUpdate":"31 May 2012","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2008-2011","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"af159334-2ef2-43b5-a7e2-0cfa2212c77c","title":"Zambia Sixth National Development Plan","countryId":"940df73e-bc90-40b2-a499-a1f8a7c53470","sectorIds":[],"year":"2011","description":"The Sixth National Development plan builds on the FNDP and contributes to the implementation of the 2030 Vision, aiming at making Zambia \"a prosperous middle-income country by 2030\".

The component of the MGDS II that the National Export Strategy provides is a road map for how Malawi can build its productive base in a manner that will drive export growth on a sufficient scale to maintain the level of imports.","typeId":null,"lastUpdate":"02 Feb 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2013-2018","thematicFocus":[]},{"id":"083b8d5b-8cc4-4ef2-8152-116f09da3731","title":"A Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP) Volume 2","countryId":"cdb2bc43-4d6c-4921-a992-6e321ebf88f7","sectorIds":["724fa0de-e1f3-4597-968e-eddd6688a548","9ca4db08-e2d3-4070-b09c-a2eec5ee21d4","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","bda93d6d-8715-4c5b-ad15-81cab5d87505","724fa0de-e1f3-4597-968e-eddd6688a548"],"year":"2006","description":"Based off Ethiopia’s Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP) Volume 1, this policy matrix is a subset of the essential activities of the overall Monitoring and Evaluation of the PASDEP and hence the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

To achieve these objectives, the strategy underlines the importance of strengthening the policy environment, reorganizing the sector in order to improve production, modernizing the production systems, promoting investment, establishing and maintaining quality assurance programs, promoting exports.

La meta propuesta es reducir la tasa de desempleo abierto del 8,5% actual al 7% en el 2018, mediante la creación de al menos 217.000 nuevos empleos en el mismo período. Esta meta se basa en la estimación de crecimiento de la Población Económicamente Activa (PEA) al 2018, de 195.000 personas, más las 22 mil personas que necesitamos sacar del desempleo en el mismo periodo para reducir la tasa de desempleo. Los programas incluidos en esta estrategia además tienden a una reducción considerable de la informalidad.

In particular, it outlines five main issues: 1) the phasing out of preferential agreements for major export products; 2) the country’s limited capacity to diversify its export mix to value added; 3) revenue leakage in the high performance tourism sector; 4) the limited scope of export oriented small and medium enterprises; and 5) a serious trade imbalance. To overcome these issues, the strategy aims to address cross cutting issues such as: market access negotiations, access to finance, market information, raw materials supply, transports and logistics, fiscal policy, currency fluctuations, national branding, public sector reforms, environmental sustainability, institutions, natural disasters recovery, infrastructures, education and training, land tenure, research and development, business competitiveness, quality and standards, entrepreneurship.

Specifically, Rwanda aims to achieve this objective by:  reducing the cost of trade to improve competitiveness of Rwandan goods in neighboring markets, increase volumes exported and increase the profitability of trade;  strengthening market linkages between producers, traders and markets in the informal and formal sector;  providing targeted financial and export support to producers and traders in the informal and formal sectors; and continuing to attract investment in Rwanda’s manufacturing sector to produce for the domestic and cross-border markets.

It presents a medium-term development framework to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and fulfill the authorities’ vision of Guinea as an emerging country in 15 to 25 years, respectful of Human Rights, gender equality and supportive of the Rule of Law. PRS III builds on the gains of PRS I and PRS II in terms of reinforcement of democracy, macroeconomic stability, development of human capital and management of the environment. Consequently, the major challenges to meet in order to ensure economic takeoff and progress toward achievement of MDG are: (i) governance; (ii) acceleration and diversification of economic growth; (iii) social sector deficit; (iv) employment and inclusion; (v) reduction of inequalities in revenue distribution and gender disparity; (vi) the socio-demographic challenge and reinforcement of human resources; vii) regional development and urban planning and (viii) adaptation to/offset of climate change.\nTo meet these challenges, government economic policy over the medium term (2013-2015) essentially aims to build and consolidate the bases for the future emergence of Guinea. Accordingly, there are new policy priorities: (i) Restoration of the Rule of Law and Reform of the Public Administration; (ii) Acceleration and diversification of growth; (iii) Development of social sectors; and (iv) Reduction of regional disparities and promotion of development based on decentralization. Particular attention also will be paid to promotion of human right and\ngender equality in each of these four priority areas.","typeId":"7aeb3a89-407c-4654-8c45-64602467e881","lastUpdate":"02 Feb 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2013-2015","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"4ea0758e-50f8-4cdf-867e-8901264e2b5e","title":"Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper - Grenada","countryId":"58ad83dc-6db0-40c9-af95-6e686a22cf56","sectorIds":[],"year":"2006","description":"The Interim PRSP provides an overview of the current situation of Grenada\u0027s economy and it outlines the main characteristics of poverty in the country.

The vision of the document relies on a holistic approach aiming to long-term, sustainable development. The strategy sets two main development goals to be achieved by 2020: i) gradual introduction of increased application of modernized lowland market-oriented agricultural production, adapted to climate change and focused on smallholder farmers; ii) conservation of upland ecosystems, ensuring food security and improving livelihoods of rural communities. Four specific goals have been set for the medium term (2011-2015): i) pursuing food security as the first priority in improving livelihoods; ii) increasing and modernizing production of agricultural commodities, thus establishing pro-poor and green value chains, based on smallholder farmers and targeting domestic, regional and global markets; iii) establishing sustainable production patterns in accordance to the specific conditions of each region, stabilizing shifting cultivations and taking measures for climate change adaptation; iv) improve forest management in order to ensure sustainability, preserve biodiversity and improve national forest cover.","typeId":"7aeb3a89-407c-4654-8c45-64602467e881","lastUpdate":"26 Nov 2012","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2011-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"449d9279-292b-4972-9734-a6a74e446941","title":"Kenya Apparel and Textile Industry : Diagnosis, Strategy and Action Plan","countryId":"b64cfacb-1236-448d-8608-814cfa62e683","sectorIds":[],"year":"2015","description":"This strategy focuses on analysis of the Kenya’s textile and apparel sector aiming to analyze the competitiveness of\r\nthe textile and apparel sectors in Kenya, to assess policy options,and recommend critical interventions to stimulate sector growth.","typeId":"7aeb3a89-407c-4654-8c45-64602467e881","lastUpdate":"10 Feb 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"90d7221f-0f44-48de-99b3-a6ce8de53618","title":"Reviving the Traditional Sectors and Preparing for the Future: an Export-Led Growth Strategy","countryId":"82ecfb01-ec22-4731-ae70-d172eb355b59","sectorIds":["703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","89c604ca-24a7-440b-b93d-5f5bba151e8b","e4d7cdb0-6692-47a1-8ca6-a6d787e4e12d","8fbb01a4-66cf-4700-a6bd-5dafb6486ce3","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","a1e0a1e6-013c-43dd-b707-2a4e4d0b852e","6a339fcc-f819-4056-8f05-9e3473191e06","8fbb01a4-66cf-4700-a6bd-5dafb6486ce3","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","8dd6213c-935a-40f5-9096-a8be77969523","bd88986a-911c-4297-917f-1fc1f1e6fded","e4d7cdb0-6692-47a1-8ca6-a6d787e4e12d","d2694f12-97e2-4fd9-9187-f45a3f59a5c6","d2694f12-97e2-4fd9-9187-f45a3f59a5c6","93201d7b-686f-452d-9854-441ed3b04444","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","8fbb01a4-66cf-4700-a6bd-5dafb6486ce3","8dd6213c-935a-40f5-9096-a8be77969523","e4d7cdb0-6692-47a1-8ca6-a6d787e4e12d","9ca4db08-e2d3-4070-b09c-a2eec5ee21d4","451260a2-1f64-426b-af33-edfd0f7b261b","d2694f12-97e2-4fd9-9187-f45a3f59a5c6"],"year":"2010","description":"The study provides an overview of the current situation of Tunisian economy, assessing its growth potential and the potential for export.

The Palestinian National Authority also aims to improve public governance, the judicial system and the delivery of services such as education, health and social protection; enhance economic growth especially through an increase in trade with neighbours and an improvement in business environment. Infrastructures will also be restored and potentiated, also with the creation of a territorial link between Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The government will also foster economic growth and stability ensuring the sustainability of public finances and creative a more conducive economic and institutional environment. The implementation of the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) in 2008-2010 allowed to increase public revenues and to decrease expenditures, improving overall efficiency of public administration. The government plans on progressively reducing reliance of external aid in the future, relying on higher economic growth and improved revenue administration. The plan also allocates expenditures for the 2011-2013 period among four major policy sectors: governance, social, economy, infrastructure. It also identifies the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip as the single biggest challenge for the same period. Finally, the NDP provides for increasing transparency, monitoring the performance of public administration, enhancing private-public partnerships, and improving accountability and oversight of public officers as well as of the private sector.","typeId":"7aeb3a89-407c-4654-8c45-64602467e881","lastUpdate":"05 Feb 2013","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2011-2013","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"dab1b3ac-0198-4d03-95f5-bbc44c6cd2e1","title":"Kenya Vision 2030","countryId":"b64cfacb-1236-448d-8608-814cfa62e683","sectorIds":["54db828e-c35c-41e0-a186-732b3eac4526","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","724fa0de-e1f3-4597-968e-eddd6688a548","83ba4a90-18ee-4a63-bed4-5cea6afc7bd6","3db025f5-434d-46a2-88e9-16aed5ee0ccc","0657d265-fab1-4e94-94ed-af6d88933f94"],"year":"2007","description":"Kena Vision 2030 is the long-term Kenyan development plan.

Hence, the fundamental recommendations for the fibre production and processing industry are: i) to evaluate whether to rehabilitate some of the major former state-owned enterprises focused on specific products or to liquidate them; ii) to establish active programmes in order to attract foreign strategic partners, in particular in spinning; iii) to support programmes for medium-size private enterprises having a clear business plan; iv) to support public and private institutions (education and association); v) to support know-how transfer of technology, productivity improvement, processing management and product development trough Private-Public Partnerships projects. The key recommendations for the clothing industry are: i) to carry out market studies and a tailored marketing strategy for Russia and other CIS countries; ii) to enhance marketing and sales capability of enterprises through an aggressive promotion programme, including fairs and direct retailers contacts; iii) to strengthen “Legprom”, “Soyuztextil” and “Svey-Profi” to offer adequate services and training to members; iv) to improve systematically overall productivity; v) to source and buy cooperatives for raw and other materials.","typeId":"7aeb3a89-407c-4654-8c45-64602467e881","lastUpdate":"05 Feb 2013","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2009-2011","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"aa802fec-ae35-4e3f-8413-cb18bb5a24bb","title":"UNDAF 2015-2019","countryId":"ff50afe1-8f88-4d95-8fe5-04eb8d93af02","sectorIds":[],"year":"2015","description":"Under construction","typeId":"7aeb3a89-407c-4654-8c45-64602467e881","lastUpdate":"02 Feb 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2015-2019","thematicFocus":[]},{"id":"3c3d14de-da32-451f-b047-cb282390cf57","title":"Trade, Commerce and Manufacturing Sector Plan (2012-2016)","countryId":"7b9afe1b-b47c-4d40-910a-e0181dd7e8bb","sectorIds":[],"year":"2012","description":"The Trade, Commerce and Manufacturing Sector Plan proposes strategies and interventi ons that will propel development in the trade, commerce and manufacturing sector, create employment and reduce poverty levels through sti mulati on of producti on and of value additi on, resulti ng in increased incomes, welfare and purchasing ability by Samoans of goods and services.
