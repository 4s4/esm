It foresees annual GDP growth of 8.2 percent, with all states growing faster than they did under the 11th Plan. It envisions a reduction of the poverty rate by 10 percentage points, building on the generation of 50 million new work opportunities in the non-farm sector and an increase in the average schooling of the population to seven years. The Plan also targets the elimination of gender and social gaps in schooling, a decline in the infant mortality, and a gradual improvement of the ratio of girls to boys.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"26 Jul 2017","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2013-2017","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"a5996b36-3836-484a-a664-02c9d561742a","title":"Mongolia: Country Partnership Strategy (2012-2016)","countryId":"25ceba91-7a7d-4b53-a390-cebd8f5b306b","sectorIds":["34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","086469e1-0de1-4c50-859c-c13add56ee83","7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505"],"year":"2012","description":"This Country Partnership Strategy for Mongolia defines ADB\u0027s strategic approach in the country for 2012–2016. The Country Partnership Strategy for Mongolia is aligned with Strategy 2020, the country\u0027s own development strategy, and ADB\u0027s comparative strengths, and complement efforts by its development partners. ADB will support the government to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth.  ADB will assist the government to generate and sustain employment by addressing priority infrastructure gaps (especially those required for connectivity), regional economic integration, and access to basic urban services. Second, the strategy will emphasize social development, particularly access to education aimed at addressing a skills mismatch, and efficiently delivered health services.

The 31 sector plans provide the framework for implementation at the sectoral level and also represent the basis on which the MTFs are developed.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"24 May 2017","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2009-2030","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"223a5336-c1aa-468e-8629-0690209a7183","title":"Strategic Plan and Investment Program for the Development of Poultry Farming (2012)- Paraguay","countryId":"01ee5242-03e3-4842-8696-88688319e784","sectorIds":["cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2"],"year":"2012","description":"The Strategic Plan and Investment Program for the development of poultry farming, foresees the implementation of support actions for: (i) Integrated commercial production of chicken for meat at the chain\u0027s primary link level, as well as, in its industrial processing; (ii) Commercial egg production; (iii) The organized structuring of family production, boosting performance at the level of those who market poultry and eggs, through the genetic improvement of the landraces that make up the backyard production of the country, to increase the productive yield of meat and eggs , of the so-called \"Rustipollo\"; and (iv) The promotion of the consumption of chicken and eggs in the national and international markets.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"01 Nov 2017","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2012-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"f69f48f1-1421-44a1-b42f-06913679d582","title":"National Rice Development Strategy  (NRDS) (2009)- Ghana","countryId":"2af5bae7-3361-4bfb-9469-fa1c013a612c","sectorIds":["e4d7cdb0-6692-47a1-8ca6-a6d787e4e12d"],"year":"2009","description":"The GNRDS, which covers the period 2008 to 2018, proposes to double rice production taking into consideration the comparative production capacities of the three major ecologies (rain fed upland, rain fed lowland and irrigated).

The need for a National Export Strategy lies in the fact that Sri Lanka’s export performance considerably worsened since mid-1990s, losing the growth momentum it had acquired following the liberalization period. Given this scenario, the NES identifies the following main objectives: 1) to increase and sustain productivity and competitiveness of the export sector of Sri Lanka; 2) to promote the production of goods and services with greater added value and higher quality; 3) to generate a culture of exports in the country; 4) to contribute to the country’s social and economic development. The strategy outlines detailed action plans to address both sector-specific issues and cross-sector issues. Among the latters, the NES focuses on issues such as land, finance, labor, investment, trade information, quality, packaging and competency development.","typeId":"09ab7c4e-49ee-425d-92fe-9661d79fb004","lastUpdate":"12 Aug 2016","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2004-2008","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"7d9caf3b-9846-4926-8222-08e3930be912","title":"Plan estratégico de desarrollo de turismo sostenible para Ecuador- PlandeTUR 2020","countryId":"9fdb1f3f-8eaa-4f7f-aa14-560203da088f","sectorIds":["2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950"],"year":"2007","description":"This document presents the design of the Strategic Plan for the Development of Sustainable Tourism of Ecuador to 2020 (PLANDETUR 2020), a proposal led by the Ministry of Tourism (MINTUR) and implemented by TOURISM \u0026 LEISURE ADVISORY SERVICES (T \u0026 L).

The CPF will support two complementary pillars, with six objectives.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"25 Jul 2017","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2016-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"34a6f475-c2d9-4f01-9086-095f42ad880d","title":"Operational Plan for Services (2017)-Gabon","countryId":"1501a87f-8548-4446-b5f5-c79c812ed91a","sectorIds":[],"year":"2017","description":"The  Operational Plan for Services envisages the development of more than ten service channels and lays the foundations for a digital revolution of unprecedented scale.

Dans cette perspective, une décennie après la mise en œuvre de la précédente EDIC, le gouvernement du Mali a décidé d’en faire le bilan et de réexaminer les secteurs qui ont été retenus comme prioritaires dans la stratégie nationale de développement, en l’occurrence le Cadre Stratégique pour la croissance et la réduction de la pauvreté, deuxième génération, (CSLP II), document adopté par le Conseil des Ministres en 2006. L’EDIC 2015 conduit ses analyses à la lumière des récentes réformes institutionnelles, de l’adoption des nouvelles politiques de développement, de l’évolution des performances macroéconomiques nationales, régionales et mondiales, ainsi que des études sectorielles afin d’identifier une stratégie d’opérationnalisation détaillée et un programme d\u0027actions concrètes qui puissent mener vers une croissance inclusive. Elle portera une attention particulière aux différentes contraintes structurelles auxquelles le pays est confronté, notamment la compétitivité du secteur privé, la dépendance de l\u0027économie à l\u0027égard du financement externe, la facilitation des échanges et l\u0027insuffisance des infrastructures.","typeId":"916e18cc-8dbc-4358-8fe6-2dd57b054a09","lastUpdate":"08 Oct 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2015-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"7185310d-f4e4-4ed4-86b9-09cc5e73711c","title":"UNDAF Nigeria (2009-2012)","countryId":"89a42705-425d-4b55-9db7-4d0aa6760709","sectorIds":[],"year":"2008","description":"The United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) is aligned with the National Vision 2020 and the National Development Plan, thus focusing on four main axes: i) strengthening governance and accountability; ii) promoting productivity and employment; iii) transforming social service delivery; iv) reducing risk pertaining to crisis, conflict and insecurity.","typeId":"a70487e5-9325-4255-b770-8b9ceca4ce89","lastUpdate":"11 Aug 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2009-2012","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"970cd4f1-89c2-4f78-b633-0a5edc3072d6","title":"Armenia; Country Gender Assessment","countryId":"3dab6c55-3eb2-4e13-930c-3c0dd45aec74","sectorIds":["8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505","f4e7d90b-bf7d-4abb-8757-9802f4c772d7"],"year":"2015","description":"While the country gender assessment is a stand-alone document that builds upon the experience gained by ADB in supporting gender equality and women’s empowerment in Armenia, it also informs the formulation of ADB’s gender strategy in the country partnership strategy.

Indian agriculture continues to be the backbone of our society and it provides livelihood to nearly 50 per cent of our population. India is supporting 17.84 per cent of world’s population, 15% of livestock population with merely 2.4 per cent of world’s land and 4 per cent water resources. Hence, continuous innovation and efforts towards productivity, pre \u0026 post-harvest management, processing and value-addition, use of technology and infrastructure creation is an imperative for Indian agriculture. Various studies on fresh fruits and vegetables, fisheries in India have indicated a loss percentage ranging from about 8% to 18% on account of poor post-harvest management, absence of cold chain and processing facilities. Therefore, agro processing and agricultural exports are a key area and it is a matter of satisfaction that India’s role in global export of agricultural products is steadily increasing. India is currently ranked tenth amongst the major exporters globally as per WTO trade data for 2016.  India’s share in global exports of agriculture products has increased from 1% a few years ago, to 2.2 % in 2016.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"05 Dec 2019","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2018-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"f8c3e1c7-2701-4d50-95c7-0bf79bbfa9e2","title":"UNDAF Eritrea (2007-2011)","countryId":"ad397874-13b3-4064-b824-79decda97e71","sectorIds":[],"year":"2006","description":"The UNDAF builds on national policies and on the Millennium Development Goals in order to set five main area of cooperation between the UN and the government of Eritrea: 1) basic social services; 2) national capacity development for attaining MDGs; 3) food security; 4) emergency and recovery; 5) gender equality.","typeId":"a70487e5-9325-4255-b770-8b9ceca4ce89","lastUpdate":"11 Aug 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2007-2011","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"0cd31c7c-7f1a-4074-8b61-0c30dcb7551d","title":"Apuesta Exportadora Agropecuaria (2006-2020)- Colombia","countryId":"82bb5f6c-151c-4c03-9c67-8edbb1928306","sectorIds":["2ee2c112-e8be-44fe-b0d8-13169edcf2f4","d2694f12-97e2-4fd9-9187-f45a3f59a5c6","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","b2e2073b-280c-418c-b7d3-249b71d76eef","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","a1e0a1e6-013c-43dd-b707-2a4e4d0b852e","2403af10-fa09-4ba6-9d19-4b6bc0dfab33","1a4188d3-ca4e-468a-9077-69ab2b7b25de","54db828e-c35c-41e0-a186-732b3eac4526"],"year":"2006","description":"El Gobierno Nacional a través del Ministerio de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural, lideró un proceso de consulta y diálogo, a través del cual se identificaron los diez grupos de productos de mayor potencial para la exportación, las regiones del país que ofrecen las mejores condiciones para su producción y los instrumentos de política que servirán de apoyo para incrementar su competitividad y asegurar su ingreso a los mercados externos.

The strategy focuses on three key initiatives: 1) strengthening the legal and institutional framework to decentralize environmental and natural resources management for sustainable development; 2) developing alternate livelihood strategies, taking pressure off natural resources, and treating the environment and natural resources as economic goods with market values; and 3) creating mass awareness in sustainable utilization, development and management of natural resources and the environment, for socio-economic development.

However, it is important to reference these issues when elaborating on the context of Nicaragua as they are significant to its development. With a per capita income of $1,239 in 2011,5 Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Real GDP per capita has grown at only 2.8 percent annually since 2005, resulting in little impact on widespread poverty – currently 43 percent nationally and 63 percent in rural areas. Due to its geographical position, Nicaragua is highly vulnerable to climate change and its effects such as hurricanes, intense flooding, and droughts. Among the countries most affected by meteorological phenomena, Nicaragua ranks fourth in the Climate Risk Index (CRI) 1998-2011. In recent years, growing economic losses have been caused by intense rains followed by droughts. Coupled with the country’s limited adaptation capabilities and its poorly prepared population, Nicaragua’s vulnerability to climate change continues to grow.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"19 Nov 2019","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2013-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"6d4a8e17-d346-4ccb-abd8-0f3ca230a556","title":"Zambia Fifth National Development Plan","countryId":"940df73e-bc90-40b2-a499-a1f8a7c53470","sectorIds":["7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","0657d265-fab1-4e94-94ed-af6d88933f94","546c1bbd-5d05-4805-a720-ea197c91ef1a","fbc6562c-9576-415d-a0a3-e5fbe6788545","b175ddc5-c657-4de6-90c7-de36e7c6bd14","9fa4fea8-6c8f-40e8-9ece-57aea5e1e71a","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505"],"year":"2006","description":"The FNDP emphasizes the need of economic and social planning in order to achieve national development and aims at broad based wealth and job creation through citizenry participation and technological advancement.

This includes actions to improve labor supply and demand as well as institutional quality and government capacities.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"06 Nov 2019","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2018-2022","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"d0470123-f354-4bf2-bbbe-12c738e68cc2","title":"Politica Nacional de Innovacion para la Competitividad","countryId":"70b8afb5-2201-4b3e-8f24-8214ee594660","sectorIds":["0657d265-fab1-4e94-94ed-af6d88933f94","b2e2073b-280c-418c-b7d3-249b71d76eef","bd88986a-911c-4297-917f-1fc1f1e6fded","41c966ec-48a8-4b68-9fb4-a6ca51374c55","2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950"],"year":"2009","description":"The plan provides for the implementation of policies aiming at increasing productivity, innovation and competitiveness in some specific high-potential sectors, dealing at the same time with cross-sectoral issues such as environment and sustainability, biotechnology, renewable energy, biofuels, energy efficiency and information communication technology.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"25 Aug 2016","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2009-2010","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"08e9c6ee-2e1a-4b07-8414-12c8d2c987ea","title":"Uganda Apiculture Export Strategy","countryId":"4e5c40d7-ad08-4e17-9ca3-8962b6748951","sectorIds":["1a4188d3-ca4e-468a-9077-69ab2b7b25de"],"year":"2005","description":"The main goal of the strategy is to transform Uganda’s predominantly subsistence apiculture farmers into viable market oriented entrepreneurs able to export a wide range of apiary products and thus generate substantial and sustained revenue inflows. The main objectives of the strategy are: 1) to establish policies and craft an economic environment which would enable sector development; 2) to strengthen the private sector institutional framework involved with the development of the apiary industry; 3) to increase the technical capacity of the sector to meet market place requirements; 4) to attract the necessary investments in the sector; 5) to modernize the production and processing systems along the entire value chain; 6) to promote the products in the regional and international markets mainly by branding Uganda as a source of natural and organic specialty honeys. To achieve these objectives, the strategy underlines the importance of strengthening the policy environment, reorganizing the sector in order to improve production, modernizing the production systems, promoting investment, establishing and maintaining quality assurance programs, promoting exports. The document carries out a detailed analysis of the apiculture sector, outlining its main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats; and it provides a detailed action matrix and a framework for implementation.","typeId":"e0c2b847-ffc5-421f-a0aa-4a2f90ad8408","lastUpdate":"15 Aug 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2005-2009","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"47b6b114-d76d-44bc-bb92-12d55ada0ee7","title":"National Development Strategy","countryId":"3f3f1cc9-0028-4c98-be15-28293168f64b","sectorIds":["31cf82a7-149f-476c-92b0-eae5e8ca501f","93201d7b-686f-452d-9854-441ed3b04444","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","3f2f9fdd-b935-40e1-a947-da1be02ee98d","e4d7cdb0-6692-47a1-8ca6-a6d787e4e12d","2403af10-fa09-4ba6-9d19-4b6bc0dfab33","b2e2073b-280c-418c-b7d3-249b71d76eef","9ca4db08-e2d3-4070-b09c-a2eec5ee21d4","bda93d6d-8715-4c5b-ad15-81cab5d87505","89c604ca-24a7-440b-b93d-5f5bba151e8b","2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950","50d9fb09-a484-4e7b-96d8-6d102197d168","bda93d6d-8715-4c5b-ad15-81cab5d87505","4e869a4e-ec69-4624-a1ce-11c2b7927067","bda93d6d-8715-4c5b-ad15-81cab5d87505","80e60b8d-b762-4608-8766-cfd54d3cc282","4540795e-3705-4f40-9ef8-a136adf50a04","8dd6213c-935a-40f5-9096-a8be77969523","1a4188d3-ca4e-468a-9077-69ab2b7b25de","4ffd315b-de21-4072-87d1-60e345cdb689","a9205727-b4f1-4682-9911-3ca9449c9e09","31cf82a7-149f-476c-92b0-eae5e8ca501f","126ae1f3-932d-42ee-9ec4-44df17ef1189"],"year":"2000","description":"The National Development Strategy for Guyana aims to achieve the following objectives: i) to attain the highest rates of economic growth that are possible; ii) to eliminate poverty in Guyana; iii) to achieve geographical unity; iv) to attain an equitable geographical distribution of economic activity; and v) to diversify the economy.

Third, any new IBRD and IFC lending will be highly selective, and subject to rigorous selectivity criteria. These include, first and foremost, that all new IBRD financing is aimed at building essential institutional capacity. In addition, at least one of the following criteria would also have to be met for financing: (i) providing innovative solutions that benefit the marginalized, poor and vulnerable; (ii) catalyzing private sector investment or leveraging additional resources, including access to and efficient utilization of EU grants; and/or (iii) contributing to regional and global public goods.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"05 Nov 2019","regionId":"a9051429-6a0a-46de-ac0e-f3117cbe5c73","implementationPeriod":"2019-2024","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"d258d87c-72cb-4e94-9694-17f2e96909d7","title":"Industrial Upgrading and Modernization Programme for the East Africa Region","countryId":"3a04839a-890e-4d7b-bad4-40f29b2b9d3c","sectorIds":["cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","d1cc4143-6e19-412b-b705-aab7c3a5ab85","126ae1f3-932d-42ee-9ec4-44df17ef1189"],"year":"2012","description":"The Programme addresses the challenges of manufacturing SMEs in five EAC Partner States – Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.

La meta propuesta es reducir la tasa de desempleo abierto del 8,5% actual al 7% en el 2018, mediante la creación de al menos 217.000 nuevos empleos en el mismo período. Esta meta se basa en la estimación de crecimiento de la Población Económicamente Activa (PEA) al 2018, de 195.000 personas, más las 22 mil personas que necesitamos sacar del desempleo en el mismo periodo para reducir la tasa de desempleo. Los programas incluidos en esta estrategia además tienden a una reducción considerable de la informalidad. El presente documento consta de tres partes: una breve descripción de la situación laboral en el país; los lineamientos de la estrategia; y una propuesta de acción para el corto plazo.

ADB assistance will focus on creating a more diversified and productive economy. ADB will support the government’s poverty reduction initiatives under the National Development Strategy, 2011–2020 through assistance in three sectors: transport, energy, and public sector management. In line with ADB’s approach to engagement in fragile situations, ADB assistance will embody (i) selectivity and focus; (ii) strategic partnerships (by collaborating with development partners to implement commitments under the Paris Declaration to harmonization, alignment, ownership, and results-based management); and (iii) flexible institutional responses and modalities.  ADB will continue to (i) focus its assistance on a selected number of sectors where ADB has core strengths; (ii) remain engaged in these core areas of support for the long term; (iii) support state building by helping develop effective institutions and country systems; and (iv) promote harmonization by participating in the CEWG process, by cofinancing operations, by working with development partners toward a sector-wide approach in transport, and by supporting government-led reforms in public sector financial management and the business environment. Building a more productive workforce is essential to economic diversification.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"09 Aug 2017","regionId":"604fdd0d-ccfb-4c2c-8676-8778e373f3c5","implementationPeriod":"2012-2016","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"a4e232f4-864d-46be-98e8-1e42862ec0cf","title":"Building a New Zimbabwe: Targeted Policies for Growth and Job Creation","countryId":"940d48bf-fea6-4a42-9e24-8e5799a3a5c5","sectorIds":["2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2"],"year":"2018","description":"Zimbabwe has investment opportunities requiring minimal additional investments to realize medium-term growth targets.

L’économie réelle (contribution et croissance sectorielle), sur la longue période, l’évolution et la structure du commerce extérieur, les politiques commerciales et le financement de l’économie seront analysés successivement ; Les politiques commerciales (accords d’association et accession à l’Organisation Mondiale du Commerce) feront l’objet d’une analyse détaillée dans la deuxième partie. Le rapport s’attachera à noter les avancées, les hésitations voire les reculs enregistrés en matière de politiques commerciales ainsi que leurs conséquences ;  La troisième partie, en prenant appui, sur les informations et les résultats réunis dans les parties I et II s’attachera, dans le détail, à analyser la structure et la nature des avantages comparés de l’Algérie et par voie de conséquences les opportunités et risques d’une plus grande ouverture au commerce mondial ou d’une plus grande fermeture, l’enjeu majeur étant la diversification.

The timing of the new CPF follows the preparation of the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) prepared in FY15, and informs the areas and objectives of the CPF in support of the WBG’s twin goals to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity for the bottom forty percent of the population. The CPF proposes to focus WBG support in selective areas aligned with the SCD, in response to clear Government demand, supporting and complementing Bulgaria’s European Union agenda, and reflecting the WBG’s comparative advantage. In addition, the CPF applies two key principles for engagement, including: (i) realism, recognizing that the WBG plays a selective role and that it will contribute most effectively by being strategic and catalytic in supporting key elements of Bulgaria’s development agenda, and (ii) scalability, creating opportunities to engage in dialogue and analytical work that may create space for broader engagement in areas where there is potential for transformational impact, including IFC investments in private sector development. Government demand is focused primarily on the agenda to strengthen public institutions, notably in the financial and energy sectors.

The OP II sets out two levels of results expected from UN and Government of Pakistan cooperation for the period 2013-2017. Outcome level results are grouped within six Strategic Priority Areas. Outcome level results articulate planned institutional or social behavioral changes to which the UN will contribute, along with the Government and other development partners.

The objective is to enhance the direct contribution of the ADB–Philippines partnership in the PDP results areas while also addressing selective longer-term governance reforms. ADB is increasingly testing innovative and knowledge solutions, drawing on its position to identify and influence trends in the Asia and Pacific region, its capacity for interdisciplinary and integrated approaches, its ability to blend knowledge with development finance, and its capacity to facilitate knowledge exchange and cooperation among developing countries in the region. During the country partnership strategy (CPS) implementation, ADB will strengthen partnerships through (i) intensified engagement in the Philippine Development Forum and its working groups; (ii) stakeholder consultations; and (iii) establishment of an advisory board of eminent people, including academics and representatives of civil society organization, to advise on ADB’s country program and operations and on ways to strengthen development effectiveness in the context of country developments.","typeId":"f783f867-7cac-46e4-83d4-f2a50774d984","lastUpdate":"26 Jul 2017","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2011-2016","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"8e84cf1b-7962-481f-9a24-2cffec9dc771","title":"Niger Country Strategy Paper (2018-2022)","countryId":"a334f112-6b0f-4731-b453-5a477b370b16","sectorIds":["086469e1-0de1-4c50-859c-c13add56ee83","7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2"],"year":"2018","description":"The objective of CSP 2018-2022 is to support Government\u0027s efforts aimed at strengthening resilience and accelerating Niger’s economic growth, with a view to achieving the objectives of sustainable and inclusive economic growth set out in PDES 2017-2021, through two main pillars: (i) Promote the competitiveness of the economy to unlock its potential and foster job creation; and (ii) Promote the development of resilient agriculture for highly sustainable and inclusive growth.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"21 Oct 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2018-2022","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"721e9fc4-6f29-4503-a4cc-2d09130976f7","title":"Country Operations Business Plan (2017-2019)","countryId":"3035ca62-2c2b-4b71-8df0-fe335f5750b9","sectorIds":["7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","b175ddc5-c657-4de6-90c7-de36e7c6bd14"],"year":"2016","description":"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business plan (COBP), 2017–2019 for Tuvalu is aligned with ADB’s Pacific Approach, 2016–2020, which guides ADB’s operational assistance in the Pacific and serves as the country partnership strategy with an emphasis on reducing costs, managing risks, and enabling value creation.

The CPF’s objectives and program, which focus on developing the conditions for faster job creation, are consistent with the WBG’s twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The Uzbekistan Systemic Country Diagnostic (SCD) identified ten priority areas that would need to be addressed to eliminate poverty, boost shared prosperity, and enable Uzbekistan to reach upper middle-income status. The government’s strategic objectives are for Uzbekistan to achieve upper middleincome status by 2030, implying income growth averaging 6 percent annually, and in particular to create 500,000 jobs annually. Building country systems for statistical, fiduciary, safeguard, and statistical capacity underlie the foundation of this CPF. The CPF program will remain flexible as circumstances change and new opportunities may arise.","typeId":"f783f867-7cac-46e4-83d4-f2a50774d984","lastUpdate":"23 May 2017","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2016-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"3d10c52e-7eff-4b7f-aa46-327d6f7878ff","title":"UNDAF Iran; (2017-2021)","countryId":"64b32e34-dfd6-4a8a-bc20-c2fa38c41390","sectorIds":["cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","086469e1-0de1-4c50-859c-c13add56ee83","5bdc38de-2f19-40b6-a4de-f228163cc6a6","546c1bbd-5d05-4805-a720-ea197c91ef1a","02606a49-dcac-457d-8a5b-de41eded251c","8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505"],"year":"2015","description":"The primary purpose of the UNDAF is to clearly profile how the UN system in Iran will contribute, in a coordinated way, to the development priorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran (henceforth Iran).

Home to about 2 million people, Lesotho is surrounded by South Africa, the second largest and most industrialized economy in Africa. Lesotho generates income mainly by exporting textiles, water, and diamonds, and is a member of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Common Monetary Area (CMA). The national currency, the loti, is pegged to the South African rand. Lesotho\u0027s main trading partners are South Africa and the United States. The CPF will seek to mitigate four substantial risks to the implementation of the WBG program: (a) political and governance; (b) macroeconomic; (c) climate change and climate- induced disasters; and (d) operating risks (capacity and fiduciary).

To this end, the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2016-2020 focuses on upstream support and is strategic, forward looking and fully aligned to both the medium and long term National Development Plans (NDP II 2015/6-2019/20 and Vision 2040).","typeId":"a70487e5-9325-4255-b770-8b9ceca4ce89","lastUpdate":"18 Jul 2017","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2016-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"63bed39d-8a60-4ef1-9842-3bb1585b659e","title":"UNDAF Yemen (2012-2015)","countryId":"8ab1c1dd-bf5d-4314-9223-3d1c44f8ea16","sectorIds":[],"year":"2011","description":"The United Nations Development Assistance Framework builds on the National Government\u0027s priorities and on the Millennium Development Goals.

USAID then greatly expanded the Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE) as the OU’s sole program to provide significant new financial and technical resources to this international initiative to conserve the planet’s second largest tropical rainforest and its threatened biodiversity. CARPE has assembled a large network of implementing partners including a large number of international conservation NGOs and federal agencies which count among them the Department of Interior (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, U.S. Geological Service), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (U.S. Forest Service, Foreign Agricultural Service). The CARPE Strategic Plan set forth an ambitious set of objectives for the period 2003-2011. A mid­ term evaluation in 2005-06 allowed USAID to consolidate and refine program activities and tactics while an External Evaluation completed in 2011 assessed progress against the stated goals and objectives. Among other findings, the External Evaluation concluded that CARPE had been extraordinarily successful in introducing large-scale ecosystem management approaches through the “landscape program” and recommended that CARPE should be refined and continued through 2020 with greater focus on policy reform to support sustainable forest management systems and to more directly support local communities’ clear access rights to forest resources and associated ecosystems services payments.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"20 Nov 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2011-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"45c13eb9-6157-442e-9862-3c453d3b72ed","title":"Sao Tomé and Principe; Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) Update","countryId":"c856a955-1551-491e-8b56-22954fa08ebf","sectorIds":["b2e2073b-280c-418c-b7d3-249b71d76eef","2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","54db828e-c35c-41e0-a186-732b3eac4526","7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f"],"year":"2013","description":"The DTIS update for the Republic of Sao Tome and Principe objectives’ are the following: take stock of progress in the mainstreaming of trade in the National Development Plan and of the implementation of Action matrix recommendations.

Changes include the recent opening of borders with China and Uzbekistan during 2016/17 and increased trade with Afghanistan, reversing more than a century of adverse historic developments. These developments have reopened nearby export markets and reduced the costs of trading with new markets. To succeed in this potentially transformative move towards an economy integrated with neighbors and wider markets, Tajikistan will need to address principal structural,  macroeconomic, and environmental legacy issues. Going forward, fiscal constraints, persisting inequalities, and a deceleration in poverty reduction call for an urgent upgrade of policies. Adopting policies that ensure opportunity for all, allow for more openness and accountability, protect the poor, and address inequalities will reduce fragility, increase resilience, and improve citizens’ standard of living.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"05 Nov 2019","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2019-2023","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"5c4bc070-6e4e-49e8-bcf4-3ed188e0f3ea","title":"Plan Estratégico del Sector Agroalimentario de Honduras (2014-2018)","countryId":"6e8d1eba-0cc8-498d-b8ca-84f89b2adaae","sectorIds":["cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2"],"year":"2015","description":"The document contains 9 chapters; 1.

It builds on the results and lessons of Belize’s first Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) that covered the period FY12-15. This CPF is well aligned with the Government’s long-term development vision, Horizon 2030: National Development Framework 2010-2030, and the thematic priorities emerging from the 2016 Belize Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD). The overarching goal of the proposed CPF is to support Belize in strengthening its economic resilience. Recognizing the special characteristics of a small state with associated capacity and absorptive constraints, the CPF proposes a consolidated and focused program. This will be the second full strategy for Belize, with the engagement still maturing, and it factors in lessons from the implementation of the first strategy. Therefore, the CPF will retain flexibility in some elements of the engagement that will be further defined with the Government during implementation. The Performance and Learning Review (PLR) at mid-point will incorporate necessary adjustments including in the Results Framework. The CPF is organized around two focus areas: (a) fostering climate resilience and environmental sustainability; and (b) promoting Financial Inclusion and social resilience. To support these focus areas, the CPF envisages the implementation of a program that could reach up to US$30 million in new loans, subject to how program performance evolves in the course of the CPF period, continued Government interest in IBRD financing, and on IBRD’s lending capacity and demand from other borrowers. It will also be supported by non-lending instruments, notably Analytics and Advisory Services (ASAs), regional initiatives and trust fund resources.","typeId":"f783f867-7cac-46e4-83d4-f2a50774d984","lastUpdate":"14 Jun 2017","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2018-2022","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"46cad4f3-2391-4e5f-baea-40e28c552d81","title":"Private Sector Assesment Report: Saint Vincent and Grenadines","countryId":"4ca0a9a9-645f-4146-99b9-f4c8704731d0","sectorIds":["fb15f79a-0b0f-4d5d-8686-4d080a8baf13","0c22b60f-acc4-46a0-bcea-2d0517af061c","2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950","b175ddc5-c657-4de6-90c7-de36e7c6bd14","c31d7248-ef6d-4094-a4e5-db209f5ad0bd"],"year":"2013","description":"The Private Sector Assessment Report (PSAR) for St. Vincent and the Grenadines presents an overall assessment of private-sector development and policy recommendations for facilitating and accelerating private-sector investment and growth.

Throughout all of USAID/Southern Africa’s development objectives there is a concerted effort to improve regional collaboration, capacity, and economic competitiveness. The Mission’s ultimate goal is to create the conditions where its work is no longer needed. This goal can only be attained if the assistance delivered strengthens the local actors and institutions that are ultimately responsible for transforming the Southern Africa region. As such, the USG, through USAID’s regional strategy and assistance agreements, will commit to strengthening the capacity of Southern African regional organizations. The Mission views regional economic, social, and political integration as key to the lasting success of development efforts in the region, including the work of USAID’s bilateral missions. Being able to move goods across borders, peacefully settle disputes regarding cross-boundary resources, and share best practices from one country to the next will create an environment for sustainable growth.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"20 Nov 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2011-2019","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"4254ce7a-92d5-4b3a-b377-43179d795c65","title":"Estrategia Nacional TIC (20016-2026)- Panama","countryId":"eb3e22d3-5b2d-46ee-8952-e2d446779567","sectorIds":["93a5a24d-bb1f-4dbc-ae3a-beed2ca13dbb"],"year":"2015","description":"This document contains the update of the National Strategy Tic 2008 - 2018, contracted by the National Secretariat of Science, Technology and Innovation (Senacyt).

Accelerating progress in gender equality, fostering regional cooperation and integration, and leveraging private sector investment and public–private partnerships are priorities that are mainstreamed in all strategic objectives.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"04 Dec 2019","regionId":"604fdd0d-ccfb-4c2c-8676-8778e373f3c5","implementationPeriod":"2020-2022","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"b3632b56-fcc2-468b-8292-4619defe3467","title":"Action Programme of the Government of Republic of Moldova (2016-2018)","countryId":"1fc027e8-ee4c-4034-b07a-c5559e446c1d","sectorIds":["cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","9fa4fea8-6c8f-40e8-9ece-57aea5e1e71a","607a726d-6c1d-4108-a7fb-304328adbb28","546c1bbd-5d05-4805-a720-ea197c91ef1a","a6497fa4-2efa-4973-a45d-09526ecb9f25","9fa4fea8-6c8f-40e8-9ece-57aea5e1e71a","b175ddc5-c657-4de6-90c7-de36e7c6bd14","8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505","119fe7c7-5503-4ce5-bc47-f06837182add"],"year":"2016","description":"This programme, which underpins the activity of the Government of Republic of Moldova for 2016-2018, has as main objective to increase the welfare, safety and quality of the life of citizens, in particular by: economic development and facilitating well paid job creation, eradication of corruption and ensuring the rule of law, personal security, national defence capacity building, accessible and cost-effective public services, social protection for vulnerable populations.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"05 Dec 2019","regionId":"a9051429-6a0a-46de-ac0e-f3117cbe5c73","implementationPeriod":"2016-2018","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"a69e61d3-0ebe-4a39-930c-461fb86ee410","title":"UNDAF Ghana (2012-2016)","countryId":"2af5bae7-3361-4bfb-9469-fa1c013a612c","sectorIds":[],"year":"2011","description":"The fourth UNDAF for Ghana operates in full alignment with the GSGDA and it focuses on four main areas: 1) food security and nutrition;

The CPF will work through two focus areas as a way to renew the social contract between the state and the citizens: (i) expand access to and quality of service delivery; and (ii) expand economic opportunities and increase human capital. Through these two focus areas, the WBG will help Lebanon mitigate the economic and social impact of the Syria crisis, safeguard the country’s development gains, and enhance the prospects for stability and development in the coming years. The CPF will contribute to strengthening the relationship between the state and its citizens, a critical ingredient for peace and stability.

The rapidly growing population exacerbates high levels of youth unemployment and amplifies pressures on social, natural and other resources. Inadequately addressed, these issues will lead to a growing number of marginalized Ugandans without access to public or other services, lacking resilience to shocks and stresses, held back from progress and, thus, unable to realize their individual or collective potential.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"20 Nov 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2016-2021","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"ad33034d-8bef-4666-aa5d-4b7a171ab157","title":"National Export Strategy Fiji (2007-2012)","countryId":"743388e7-1bf1-4ff2-bb7e-0c02495dd299","sectorIds":["80e60b8d-b762-4608-8766-cfd54d3cc282","b2e2073b-280c-418c-b7d3-249b71d76eef","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","3db025f5-434d-46a2-88e9-16aed5ee0ccc","119fe7c7-5503-4ce5-bc47-f06837182add","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","1a4188d3-ca4e-468a-9077-69ab2b7b25de","4ffd315b-de21-4072-87d1-60e345cdb689","546c1bbd-5d05-4805-a720-ea197c91ef1a","e4d7cdb0-6692-47a1-8ca6-a6d787e4e12d","b55d80eb-92ac-425d-8957-73f53082cc28","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","2403af10-fa09-4ba6-9d19-4b6bc0dfab33"],"year":"2007","description":"The central theme of the Fiji National Export Strategy is “a dynamic and competitive exporter for prosperity through a national partnership”. The strategy analyses the current export performance of the country and it identifies the main challenges to be addresses for the country to successfully participate in the international market place. In particular, it outlines five main issues: 1) the phasing out of preferential agreements for major export products; 2) the country’s limited capacity to diversify its export mix to value added; 3) revenue leakage in the high performance tourism sector; 4) the limited scope of export oriented small and medium enterprises; and 5) a serious trade imbalance. To overcome these issues, the strategy aims to address cross cutting issues such as: market access negotiations, access to finance, market information, raw materials supply, transports and logistics, fiscal policy, currency fluctuations, national branding, public sector reforms, environmental sustainability, institutions, natural disasters recovery, infrastructures, education and training, land tenure, research and development, business competitiveness, quality and standards, entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the strategy identifies 13 sectors with higher export potential, providing for each one of them a detailed implementation plan.","typeId":"09ab7c4e-49ee-425d-92fe-9661d79fb004","lastUpdate":"15 Aug 2016","regionId":"604fdd0d-ccfb-4c2c-8676-8778e373f3c5","implementationPeriod":"2007-2012","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"6df41e7b-aa7f-4c5d-b402-4b8c80c5665b","title":"Framework for Economic Growth","countryId":"8641f4ae-f4cb-4b4b-85b4-9a9633ad63a7","sectorIds":[],"year":"2011","description":"The document provides a framework for economic growth in Pakistan.

The low level of growth is linked to the narrowness of the private sector and the economy’s structural inability to increase the gross investment rate, which has fluctuated over the past six years to end up not much better than 12 per cent. Both investment and the quality of the educational system determine how competitive the economy is. The source of these impediments must therefore be studied, with emphasis on factor costs and the failure of certain institutions to promote international trade.","typeId":"916e18cc-8dbc-4358-8fe6-2dd57b054a09","lastUpdate":"07 Oct 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2004-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"0b7c86a3-549b-4809-8f72-4b9d17b07d88","title":"Vision Colombia 2019","countryId":"82bb5f6c-151c-4c03-9c67-8edbb1928306","sectorIds":[],"year":"2005","description":"The Colombia National Vision 2019 is organized around two major principles: 1) Consolidate a profoundly democratic political model, based on the principles of freedom, tolerance and brotherhood; 2) Strengthen a socioeconomic model without exclusion, based on equality of opportunity and a state guarantee of social equity.

Already familiar with Korea’s development experience, President Fernandez participated in a special seminar on knowledge economy and engaged in a lively discussion with KDI scholars. He subsequently instructed Minister Eddy Martinez Manzueta of the Export and Investment Center of the Dominican Republic (Centro de Exportación e Inversión de la República Dominicana, or CEI-RD) to seek cooperation with the KDI. Although the Dominican Republic has made a successful transition from “a dessert economy” specializing in sugar, coffee, and tobacco exports to a low-cost garment manufacturer and tourist destination, some of the international factors that have facilitated this transition are either already gone or about to disappear. For instance, the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) was terminated in 2005, and exemptions for free trade zones from the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are scheduled to be phased out after 2013. The country should now take a much more comprehensive approach to development and aim to transform itself into a globally connected smart island such as Ireland and Singapore. An outward orientation is a prerequisite for the strategic repositioning of the Dominican Republic. A strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) analysis for the Dominican Republic indicates that the country has the potential to play the global supply chain game but suffers from macroeconomic imbalances and the dual-economy structure with weak domestic linkages and limited industrial upgrading and diversification. Strengths for the Dominican Republic include proximity to a major market (i.e., the United States) and experience with export agriculture, industrialization, and tourism. Weaknesses include external and internal imbalances and a low level of investment, trade, an","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"24 Aug 2017","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"76ad44b1-ff27-4848-84dd-51d52d4d7689","title":"Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper - Lesotho 2005-2007","countryId":"b9b32958-3621-44e1-a63b-e3fbcb1f6e38","sectorIds":[],"year":"2004","description":"The Poverty Reduction Strategy outlines a mid-term development plan in allignement with the National Vision 2020 and the Millennium Development Goals.

These and related issues are being addressed in the Policy with a view to placing Botswana in the world economic arena as an equal trading partner and beneficiary in world trade.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"22 Aug 2017","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"50644186-2247-409b-8b1c-523108ea1c4f","title":"Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper Tajikistan (2010-2012)","countryId":"2881f8c1-951f-40c2-ae24-679447eabf9e","sectorIds":[],"year":"2010","description":"The document provides an overview of the results achieved through the 2007-2009 Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), and it outlines the current social and economic situation in Tajikistan.

This review consists of two parts: the first report, the “Assessment Report”, presents the different developments of the trade policy framework since 2010, evaluating its contribution to Botswana’s trade performance. A second report, the “National Trade Policy 2016-2020”, will be an update of the current trade policy, incorporating proposals for the realignment of objectives, instruments and guidelines to be adopted by the Government of Botswana. The two main objectives of this Assessment Report are: (i) to provide an in-depth assessment of Botswana’s trade performance and its engagement in the world trading system at the bilateral, regional and multilateral level, taking into account policies and economic developments that have occurred since the adoption of the NTP; and (ii) to identify the economic, policy and institutional constraints and opportunities faced by Botswana. The aim of the report is to serve as the basis for the development of the NTP 2016-2020.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"12 Jun 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2016-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"bf855ed9-3930-4b3e-a51a-5b8b70c6c503","title":"National Strategy for Sustainable Development - Moldova 21","countryId":"1fc027e8-ee4c-4034-b07a-c5559e446c1d","sectorIds":[],"year":"2000","description":"The final goal of the strategy is to achieve wealth, health and the education of society while ensuring the conservation and regeneration of natural resources, and guaranteeing their availability for future generations.

The Country Partnership Strategy for Bangladesh is aligned with Strategy 2020, the country\u0027s own development strategy, and ADB\u0027s comparative strengths, and complement efforts by its development partners. The overarching objective of ADB support will be to contribute to the government’s Sixth Five-Year Plan goals and commitments for enhancing growth and reducing poverty. Towards this objective, ADB’s CPS will provide assistance within Strategy 2020’s development agendas of inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional cooperation. In consideration of the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change, ADB will help the government address binding constraints on growth in ways that foster environmental sustainability, reduce disaster risks, and respond to challenges posed by climate change and disaster emergencies. Harnessing emerging opportunities to foster regional cooperation and integration will also be a priority. The strategy is to make the growth process more inclusive and greener by improving connectivity, building the country\u0027s skills base, deepening its financial markets, boosting energy efficiency and access, investing to make cities more livable, improving the management of water resources, and reducing flood risks.

The focus of this strategy is on facilitating higher volumes and values of cross-border exports, particularly with Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Tanzania and Uganda. Specifically, Rwanda aims to achieve this objective by:  reducing the cost of trade to improve competitiveness of Rwandan goods in neighboring markets, increase volumes exported and increase the profitability of trade;  strengthening market linkages between producers, traders and markets in the informal and formal sector;  providing targeted financial and export support to producers and traders in the informal and formal sectors; and continuing to attract investment in Rwanda’s manufacturing sector to produce for the domestic and cross-border markets. This paper outlines strategic interventions to achieve these goals.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"26 Aug 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2012-2017","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"3a5c4c4d-fefb-4a6f-bf50-6583abe75752","title":"National Trade Policy- Trade Policy for a Competitive Economy and Export-Led Growth","countryId":"1aeb22e3-7d60-4d6a-a5e2-cda11a6a333f","sectorIds":[],"year":"2003","description":"The objective of this National Trade Policy is to enable Tanzania identify ways and means of navigating through a viable and steady path towards competitive export-led growth for the realization of the goal of poverty eradication.

This strategy will seek to increase transparency and accountability as key drivers in strengthening democracy and unlocking the country’s potential for economic growth. These improvements will lead to improved living standards for all Moldovans and demonstrate to citizens the benefits of continued reforms. USAID assistance will at the same time help Moldova to become more integrated with the rest of Europe, both politically and economically. In this way, Moldova will benefit both from the immediate gains of a stronger democracy and a growing economy, both of which strengthen the country’s candidacy for European Union association and eventual membership. All USAID programs will be developed and implemented taking into consideration a cross-cutting civil society development approach in order to ensure that USAID’s activities engage citizens as stakeholders in the reform process and provide them with tools to fight against corruption. Activities will also ensure that women and men have equal access to opportunities for participation and that gender disparities are targeted for elimination. While graduation from U.S. assistance is beyond the timeline of this strategy, USAID will also begin to strengthen the government of Moldova’s own host country systems to respond to development challenges, such that USAID assistance plays a transformative role.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"18 Nov 2019","regionId":"a9051429-6a0a-46de-ac0e-f3117cbe5c73","implementationPeriod":"2013-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"b795b015-07c3-45b2-8c37-706f14d081de","title":"Estratégia para a Melhoria do Ambiente de Negocios","countryId":"691c1148-603a-40fa-b6c3-40b88452ad53","sectorIds":["b5d69e19-00e5-4aa5-8f7b-84a1266df81f","68d88072-02fc-43db-87c0-5b84cb553858","8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505"],"year":"2008","description":"The strategy aims to improve the business environment in Mozambique through four main channels: 1) a legal reform; 2) a reform of the financial and fiscal environment; 3) infrastructural projects; and 4) an improvement in institutional quality.

Por primera vez en un programa de Gobierno se presenta el tema de la seguridad alimentaria como uno de los compromisos del más alto nivel. En el capítulo del sector agropecuario, de dicho plan, se concibe la agricultura como una forma de vida y una actividad fundamental para el sustento económico, social y cultural de Costa Rica, pero, al mismo tiempo, como una actividad riesgosa por estar sujeta a factores como el cambio climático, las plagas y enfermedades, el vaivén de los precios internacionales de los insumos y los productos agrícolas y pecuarios. Se considera que las actividades agropecuarias y del medio rural deben garantizar los ingresos necesarios, para que las familias productoras tengan una vida digna, como motores de desarrollo de las comunidades rurales y, además, deben recibir el reconocimiento social por producir alimentos saludables para toda la población, así como su contribución con la generación de divisas, empleo y la paz social en el agro y del país.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"30 Oct 2019","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2015-2018","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"da3ce830-c8fc-4759-a76e-73311d345a45","title":"Serbia Country Strategy","countryId":"cbfcd0c7-d34b-4470-8df5-6d4941221810","sectorIds":["8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505","7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","5bdc38de-2f19-40b6-a4de-f228163cc6a6","3db025f5-434d-46a2-88e9-16aed5ee0ccc"],"year":"2018","description":"The EBRD is set to pursue the following strategic priorities in Serbia in 2018-2023:\r\nFoster Competitiveness and Governance by enhancing private companies\u0027 capacity, and reforming selected SOEs and public utilities.\r\nEnhance Integration by improving the transport network, supporting regional economic connectivity reform, and advancing energy interconnectivity.\r\nSupport Green economy by fostering energy efficiency, enhancing renewable energy,and promoting sustainable practices.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"04 Nov 2019","regionId":"a9051429-6a0a-46de-ac0e-f3117cbe5c73","implementationPeriod":"2018-2023","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"48b09843-1f45-498c-b004-7335bfc1e5de","title":"TRADE POLICY FRAMEWORK: TUNISIA","countryId":"ff50afe1-8f88-4d95-8fe5-04eb8d93af02","sectorIds":["b175ddc5-c657-4de6-90c7-de36e7c6bd14"],"year":"2015","description":"Tunisia, a developing country, became a member of the WTO in March 1995, but has not become\r\na participant in the ITA since its conclusion in 1996.

To achieve this, ADB will base its operations on three strategic pillars: (i) promoting economic and social stability, (ii) developing infrastructure for economic diversification, and (iii) strengthening environmental sustainability. The uncertainties of Mongolia’s current economic situation and the all-encompassing nature of these strategic pillars require greater flexibility in programming and focus on a wider set of sectors than is typical of ADB’s smaller developing member countries. The CPS priorities are closely aligned with the Government Action Plan (GAP), 2016–2020, which sets out a broad-based plan to foster a more inclusive and sustainable development process. The government concurs with the strategic positioning of the CPS, particularly ADB’s continued support for agriculture, natural resources, and rural development; and finance, which it views as critical to its efforts to accelerate economic diversification and job creation. The CPS also reflects the outcome of and lessons learned from the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, the final review of CPS, 2012–2016, and its validation by the Independent Evaluation Department (IED).","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"03 Aug 2017","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2017-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"5afeb0bd-87b3-4de8-8738-734387cd7c73","title":"Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper - Senegal 2006-2010","countryId":"694cac88-2693-45cf-bfc7-92901f1c8680","sectorIds":["93201d7b-686f-452d-9854-441ed3b04444","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","b2e2073b-280c-418c-b7d3-249b71d76eef"],"year":"2006","description":"The PRSP carries out an analysis of the characteristics and causes of poverty in Senegal and it outlines a strategy for poverty reduction based on four main pillars: i) wealth creation for pro-poor growth; ii) accelerated development of access to basic social services; iii) social protection, prevention and management of risks and disasters; iv) good governance and decentralized and participatory development.","typeId":"f783f867-7cac-46e4-83d4-f2a50774d984","lastUpdate":"03 Oct 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2006-2010","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"938e4354-ab62-4c52-ad90-7377252df334","title":"Pacte National pour l\u0027Emergence Industrielle","countryId":"e0fcb722-bc4d-46da-b93c-877151b8f7e6","sectorIds":["5730fc7f-0387-46fc-9222-595b1ba819c2","d2694f12-97e2-4fd9-9187-f45a3f59a5c6","126ae1f3-932d-42ee-9ec4-44df17ef1189","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","262a7aa9-8305-4312-91e6-1cb0e62d91f6","6a339fcc-f819-4056-8f05-9e3473191e06","54db828e-c35c-41e0-a186-732b3eac4526","25c2c881-ad52-4822-8868-60f8ccaa9a1a","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","6a339fcc-f819-4056-8f05-9e3473191e06"],"year":"2008","description":"The document is an agreement between the government and the private sector, as represented by the national confederation of enterprises of Morocco and the professional association of banks of Morocco.

Vision 2050 is underpinned by seven Strategic Focus Areas, which are referred to as pillars: Human Capital Development, Gender, Youth and People Empowerment; Wealth Creation; Institutional Development and Service Delivery; Security and International Relations; Environmental Sustainability and Climate Change; Spiritual, Cultural and Community Development; and Strategic Planning, Integration and Control. Papua New Guinea has great potential through its natural resources — land, cash crops, forests and fisheries — to improve its socioeconomic development status. Equally important are other areas that can contribute to economic growth and better living standards for the people, including human capital development, an improved infrastructure networks and an efficient service delivery mechanism for public goods and services. These areas underscore the underlying theme that drives Vision 2050 and the development agenda for Papua New Guinea. Based on the deterioration of the provision of public goods and services and lack of meaningful participation of the rural people in income-earning activities and their aspirations to do better, Vision 2050 incorporates the National Government’s Strategic Directional Statements that will drive development initiatives over the next 40 years.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"04 Aug 2017","regionId":"604fdd0d-ccfb-4c2c-8676-8778e373f3c5","implementationPeriod":"-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"ed42aeb4-d8b5-4c60-bdf7-785e415e8b81","title":"Guinea Country Development Strategy","countryId":"5ff47e2b-8af5-45a2-9097-79079be32014","sectorIds":["5730fc7f-0387-46fc-9222-595b1ba819c2","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505"],"year":"2018","description":"This strategy is based on the Bank\u0027s 2013-2022 Ten-Year strategy, the High 5s and the Strategy for Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in Africa.

Hence, it assesses internal issues involving Egypt\u0027s export potential.

The FY17–FY21 CPF aims to support Mozambique in achieving its objective of creating more inclusive growth through employment promotion and improving productivity and competitiveness in a sustainable manner. It focuses on a well defined set of objectives reflecting the government’s program, development priorities identified in the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), and the World Bank’s comparative advantage relative to other development partners. The government program and medium-term strategy is articulated in its five-year development plan, the Programa Quinquenal do Governo (PQG). The PQG’s overarching theme is to achieve more inclusive growth through employment promotion and improving productivity and competitiveness. The PQG has five priorities: (a) consolidate national unity, peace, and sovereignty; (b) human and social capital development; (c) promote employment and improve productivity and competitiveness; (d) economic and social infrastructure development; and (e) ensure sustainable and transparent management of natural and environmental resources. It also has three supporting pillars: (a) consolidate the democratic rule of law, good governance, and decentralization; (b) promote a balanced and sustainable macroeconomic environment; and (c) reinforce international cooperation. The PQG represents significant continuity in the focus of the government program but also some innovations. The plan avoids a sectoral approach to the country’s development challenges using a more integrated approach. The government is also seeking greater integration of the cross-cutting issues within the identified priority areas.","typeId":"f783f867-7cac-46e4-83d4-f2a50774d984","lastUpdate":"14 Jun 2017","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2017-2021","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"44322815-e65e-4005-9954-7e2aecfa6575","title":"Turkmenistan; Country Strategy Paper 2014 – 2020","countryId":"ab807095-d0a9-403d-9fdc-d638f7fcc87b","sectorIds":["34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","c31d7248-ef6d-4094-a4e5-db209f5ad0bd","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","68d88072-02fc-43db-87c0-5b84cb553858","546c1bbd-5d05-4805-a720-ea197c91ef1a"],"year":"2013","description":"The EU development cooperation during this period has concentrated on the following priority sectors: Strengthening economic and social development of rural areas; Support to the improvement of human capital development; Good governance and economic reform.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"25 Oct 2019","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2014-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"4fd5bc34-04db-476e-9eb0-7e3da2c63617","title":"Shanghai Free Trade Zone Strategic Plan","countryId":"0dd83c77-6d72-4705-9d3d-41c3dd29e805","sectorIds":["a59a3b9f-53ad-4fe5-acd2-53fc6f1c850a","5730fc7f-0387-46fc-9222-595b1ba819c2","7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","3db025f5-434d-46a2-88e9-16aed5ee0ccc"],"year":"2013","description":"Launched in 2013 as the pioneer free trade zone in China, Shanghai Free Trade Zone Strategic Plan lays out some of the boldest institutional reforms and innovations in the areas of investment, foreign trade and finance.

The emphasis is on a facilitative, rather than coercive, policy mix.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"17 Jun 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2016-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"045c014c-10a4-4a18-a8df-7e79ea19486f","title":"PLAN ESTRATÉGICO PRODUCTIVO BUENOS AIRES 2020","countryId":"989ffd50-ddad-4377-9f38-594851db4007","sectorIds":["2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","4d008930-e0cf-4960-a336-66a2c12c959f","b55d80eb-92ac-425d-8957-73f53082cc28"],"year":"2011","description":"El Plan Estratégico Productivo Buenos Aires 2020 aparece así, como la piedra angular del carácter que pretendemos darle al fortalecimiento productivo de una provincia que hoy concentra más del 37% del PBI nacional, el 56% del valor agregado industrial y más del 41% del empleo sectorial.

The goal of the CDCS is to accelerate Ghana’s transition to an established middle-income country. With an annual growth rate of 14.3 percent in 2011, making Ghana the world’s fastest growing economy, oil revenues projected at $1 billion per annum by the World Bank, and with a history of peaceful elections and regional leadership, Ghana is a lower middle income country since November 2010. In order to build upon these accomplishments and Ghana’s potential for stability, prosperity, environmental stewardship, and improved living standards, the GoG is undertaking its own planning process to reach middle-income status. Key GoG outputs from this process include: the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) 2010–2013, Ghana’s Aid Policy and Strategy (2011–2015), and the compact between the USAID/GHANA COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION STRATEGY 1 Government of Ghana and development partners 2012–2022. The Compact’s preamble states that it “should not be read as an ODA exit strategy, but should provide guidance for the strategic choices that will have to be made by the GoG and DPs alike in the period 2012–2022, as well as for the fostering of new alliances with emerging new players in development cooperation, with the ultimate goal of transforming Ghana into an established middle income and aid independent country.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"18 Nov 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2013-2019","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"3ff25229-540b-4ced-8aca-88ba71be03fb","title":"Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2013)","countryId":"5ff47e2b-8af5-45a2-9097-79079be32014","sectorIds":["8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","b175ddc5-c657-4de6-90c7-de36e7c6bd14","546c1bbd-5d05-4805-a720-ea197c91ef1a","b5d69e19-00e5-4aa5-8f7b-84a1266df81f","7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f"],"year":"2013","description":"The third poverty reduction strategy (PRS III) is the frame of reference for the overall development planning process that will be reoriented to the 2011-2015 Five-Year Plan. It presents a medium-term development framework to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and fulfill the authorities’ vision of Guinea as an emerging country in 15 to 25 years, respectful of Human Rights, gender equality and supportive of the Rule of Law. PRS III builds on the gains of PRS I and PRS II in terms of reinforcement of democracy, macroeconomic stability, development of human capital and management of the environment. Consequently, the major challenges to meet in order to ensure economic takeoff and progress toward achievement of MDG are: (i) governance; (ii) acceleration and diversification of economic growth; (iii) social sector deficit; (iv) employment and inclusion; (v) reduction of inequalities in revenue distribution and gender disparity; (vi) the socio-demographic challenge and reinforcement of human resources; vii) regional development and urban planning and (viii) adaptation to/offset of climate change.\r\nTo meet these challenges, government economic policies over the medium term (2013-2015) essentially aim to build and consolidate the bases for the future emergence of Guinea. Accordingly, there are new policy priorities: (i) Restoration of the Rule of Law and Reform of the Public Administration; (ii) Acceleration and diversification of growth; (iii) Development of social sectors; and (iv) Reduction of regional disparities and promotion of development based on decentralization. Particular attention also will be paid to promotion of human right and gender equality in each of these four priority areas.","typeId":"f783f867-7cac-46e4-83d4-f2a50774d984","lastUpdate":"18 Jul 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2013-2015","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"4ea0758e-50f8-4cdf-867e-8901264e2b5e","title":"Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper - Grenada","countryId":"58ad83dc-6db0-40c9-af95-6e686a22cf56","sectorIds":["546c1bbd-5d05-4805-a720-ea197c91ef1a","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2"],"year":"2006","description":"The Interim PRSP provides an overview of the current situation of Grenada\u0027s economy and it outlines the main characteristics of poverty in the country.

Importantly, this CDCS applies analysis and lessons learned from previous generations of programming to attempt to tackle, through cross-sectoral approaches and integration, the major obstacles to securing a democratic, resilient, and prosperous future for Malians. Mali’s most pressing needs in the North will be addressed through a Transition Objective in the short term while on-going development programming in the southern regions will be brought to scale, country-wide, once a negotiated peace accord and security permit. Through integration of governance and resilience across traditional technical sectors of economic growth, education, democracy, rights and governance and health, USAID/Mali will leverage expertise and resources to target Mali’s institutional weaknesses while contributing to ending extreme poverty. Previous attempts at cross-sectoral programming were concentrated on individual projects – this strategy differs in that integration will take place across the entire Mission, demanding a whole-of-mission contribution to tackle Mali’s development challenges.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"19 Nov 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2015-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"d6d06ad9-bd9e-4078-9a09-8ab57b98303f","title":"Afghanistan; National Export Strategy 2018-2022","countryId":"010d6483-d82d-48de-88c4-030fc5e7f81e","sectorIds":["31cf82a7-149f-476c-92b0-eae5e8ca501f","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","a9205727-b4f1-4682-9911-3ca9449c9e09","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","3db025f5-434d-46a2-88e9-16aed5ee0ccc","b3984a03-fc9e-4fd3-8266-2e2f858c2726","d2694f12-97e2-4fd9-9187-f45a3f59a5c6","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f"],"year":"2018","description":"The principal outputs of NES Afghanistan design initiative are endorsed, coherent\r\nand comprehensive export strategy documents with a five-year detailed plan of\r\naction and implementation management framework. \r\nThese documents include:\r\n1.

During the five decades that USAID has provided development assistance, Peru has made tremendous progress, notwithstanding setbacks attributed to hyperinflation, terrorism, natural disasters, and other political and economic challenges. The benefits of these joint USG-GOP investments include reduced maternal and infant mortality rates, more effective and accountable democratic institutions, and sustained, robust economic growth. The challenge now is to consolidate and sustain Peru’s development progress through targeted cooperation, leading to repositioning USAID’s role within the next ten years. This document outlines the development priorities and strategy that USAID/Peru has identified in order to achieve the goals laid out in President Obama’s Policy Directive; address all three foreign policy priorities for Latin America; increase the Mission’s focus on equal partnership and shared responsibility with the GOP; and help Peru sustain and capitalize on the progress and development realized over the last ten years.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"19 Nov 2019","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2012-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"8dc57078-e9a0-4b16-9f1d-90f5bd99f35f","title":"National Assessment Report Kiribati","countryId":"16944b59-481e-4c81-aaf4-6e0d41319535","sectorIds":["b175ddc5-c657-4de6-90c7-de36e7c6bd14","7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950","546c1bbd-5d05-4805-a720-ea197c91ef1a"],"year":"2013","description":"The report covers the period 2005 to 2013 and is a stocktaking analysis of national policies, plans, laws and regulations, adopted in the country.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"19 Jul 2016","regionId":"604fdd0d-ccfb-4c2c-8676-8778e373f3c5","implementationPeriod":"2013-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"27376240-82b9-47d2-87cf-9185f4e59eb9","title":"Revised Roadmap for Research Infrastructure of Montenegro (2019-2020)","countryId":"debdc097-257c-45f8-890a-4ac0cfa40345","sectorIds":["a6497fa4-2efa-4973-a45d-09526ecb9f25"],"year":"2019","description":"After the opening and provisional closure of Negotiation Chapter 25: Science and Research, the European Commission encouraged Montenegro to prepare and adopt a national roadmap for research infrastructure.

Finally, the above results were complemented with the findings of the Study, and the first Roadmap for Research Infrastructure of Montenegro 2015-2020 was created.

The aim was to see tourists increase their time spent in Georgia from an average of 4.3 days to 5.3 days.\r\nGeorgia also will work to increase Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) flowing into the tourism sector by 63 percent – a growth from today’s $559 million to $910 million per year.\r\nFurthermore, the tourism sector must contribute 6.7 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the economy, up from the six percent it contributed today.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"23 Oct 2017","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2016-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"b4d088da-7987-4081-8957-93f6209f373c","title":"Plan Stratégique de Développement d\u0027Haïti, Pays Emergent en 2030","countryId":"e4866671-282a-4821-b834-feb6c45c6dd7","sectorIds":["7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","086469e1-0de1-4c50-859c-c13add56ee83","b175ddc5-c657-4de6-90c7-de36e7c6bd14","8dd6213c-935a-40f5-9096-a8be77969523","9fa4fea8-6c8f-40e8-9ece-57aea5e1e71a","5bdc38de-2f19-40b6-a4de-f228163cc6a6","0657d265-fab1-4e94-94ed-af6d88933f94","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","5730fc7f-0387-46fc-9222-595b1ba819c2","546c1bbd-5d05-4805-a720-ea197c91ef1a","8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505","b2e2073b-280c-418c-b7d3-249b71d76eef","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950"],"year":"2012","description":"La version finale du Plan Stratégique de Développement d’Haïti guidera l’action publique\r\net privée au cours des prochaines années, incluant celle de nos partenaires internationaux.\r\nPlus spécifiquement, elle orientera l’élaboration des prochains Programmes triennaux\r\nd’investissement qui détailleront l’action publique future, dont le support accordé aux\r\nintervenants privés, ainsi que l’élaboration d’un nouveau Schéma National d’Aménagement\r\ndu Territoire que nous comptons entreprendre prochainement de façon à assurer une plus\r\ngrande cohérence des interventions de terrain à mettre en œuvre.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"09 Dec 2019","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2012-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"a3e1d8f8-394d-4b59-9de8-93f7bc4a7898","title":"Plan Estratégico Exportador","countryId":"82bb5f6c-151c-4c03-9c67-8edbb1928306","sectorIds":[],"year":"1999","description":"The plan outlines the core national priorities and goals for the 1999-2009 period.

The first pathway entails creation of better quality jobs through sustainable private sector-led growth in agriculture, agribusiness and the non-agribusiness sectors. The second pathway to attain inclusive growth is to build human capital, which entails improving the efficiency and quality of spending in education, health and social protection and improving access and equity to basic services, while strengthening the quality of labor needed for private sector growth. The five main prerequisites are: (a) continued social and political stability; (b) macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability; (c) land market reform; (d) financial sector development and inclusiveness; and (e) improved governance.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"25 Jul 2017","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2016-2019","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"91df8058-7165-4231-81ff-964e68a3c26e","title":"Country Operations Business Plan (2015-2017): Tajikistan","countryId":"2881f8c1-951f-40c2-ae24-679447eabf9e","sectorIds":["7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","f701fac4-6f12-4f1e-8a39-899ca3ec91b0","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2"],"year":"2014","description":"The country operations business plan (COBP) for Tajikistan for 2015–2017 is aligned with the interim country partnership strategy (CPS) for 2015, which extends the validity of the CPS, 2010–2014.

Learning from the previous two medium term frameworks i.e. 2009-12 and 2012-15, it has been ensured that procedural and budgetary bottlenecks are removed in Strategic Trade Policy Framework (STPF) 2015-18. STPF 2015-18 aims to achieve following targets by June 30, 2018: a. Enhancement of annual exports to US$ 35 Billion b. Improve Export Competitiveness c. Transition from ‘factor-driven’ economy to ‘efficiency-driven’ and ‘innovation-driven’ economy d. Increase share in regional trade. To achieve the above targets, the key enablers are: a. Competitiveness (quality infrastructure, labour productivity, access to utilities, and level of technological development) b.

Taking into account the challenges faced by El Salvador, the WBG wishes to provide a modest but catalytic role through the implementation of these six objectives.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"25 Jul 2017","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2016-2019","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"791dfedf-e9f3-4e9a-b099-997730505e51","title":"The Gambia Cashew sector development and export strategy 2014-2019","countryId":"c0a82bd6-0570-4dcf-b988-ee1a13d3c7e0","sectorIds":["4d835010-7513-481a-9739-076016495e4a"],"year":"2013","description":"The strategy has defined a number of market and strategic opportunities available to sector stakeholders to stimulate the sector’s growth.

The August 2017 U.S. South Asia Strategy reaffirms the commitment of the U.S. to Afghanistan and highlights the importance of the country’s stability to U.S. national security. Foreign assistance is crucial to addressing the security and development challenges that, in the past, have made Afghanistan a safe haven for terrorists and violent extremist organizations. It is also a vital component to achieving a political settlement that ends Afghanistan’s conflict and brings lasting stability to the country. USAID will help establish the conditions necessary for peace and self-reliance through this Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) by focusing on long-term, broad-based development in Afghanistan and by transitioning to a more mature relationship with the Government of Afghanistan (GoA). This relationship, driven by accountability for performance, will enable the GoA to take greater ownership of its country’s development. Working with the GoA, USAID will prioritize private sector-driven economic growth that creates the conditions for job growth, revenue generation, and social improvements. USAID will support the Afghan people to advance the social gains made since 2001, particularly around health, education, and opportunities for women. USAID’s development goal – which aligns with the GoA’s policy goals for self-reliance – is to help Afghanistan become a more inclusive, economically viable, and self-reliant country with which the USG can better partner in our national security strategy.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"18 Nov 2019","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2019-2023","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"19c66aa3-6bc8-4caa-a875-999140de8e24","title":"Thailand; THE TWELFTH NATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN","countryId":"7ec8648e-70d4-4663-8d11-1fd30d1ca571","sectorIds":["34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","3db025f5-434d-46a2-88e9-16aed5ee0ccc","546c1bbd-5d05-4805-a720-ea197c91ef1a","5730fc7f-0387-46fc-9222-595b1ba819c2","5bdc38de-2f19-40b6-a4de-f228163cc6a6","8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505","2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950","7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","f701fac4-6f12-4f1e-8a39-899ca3ec91b0"],"year":"2017","description":"The Twelfth National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017-2021) was formulated during a period when the world was experiencing rapid change and becoming even more integrated, whilst Thailand itself was undergoing reforms.

It will help transform Kenya into a globally competitive and prosperous country for all by using more innovative approaches to development.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"19 Nov 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2014-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"532c2e9e-785a-4efc-9066-9fe290e29023","title":"Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS)- Benin (2015)","countryId":"f92d9ea2-2b11-4e20-82c2-09e6edff0401","sectorIds":["7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","3db025f5-434d-46a2-88e9-16aed5ee0ccc","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","a1e0a1e6-013c-43dd-b707-2a4e4d0b852e","41c966ec-48a8-4b68-9fb4-a6ca51374c55","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c"],"year":"2015","description":"The DTIS Update (DTISU) offers a diagnosis, analytical framework and action plan, giving trade expansion a key role in the reduction of poverty and vulnerability.

Effectiveness of public spending will be a crosscutting issue along these three pillars. The framework will also aim to address gender and indigenous disparities. The WBG is well placed to help Peru in addressing the above three areas, given the significant country experience acquired through past and ongoing engagements. The WBG’s long-term engagement in Peru, with proven efficiency according to Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) reports, provides a solid base upon which to support these three pillars. To build on this strength, the WBG is committed to provide Peru with integrated solutions, combining both global knowledge and smart financing—all designed against the backdrop of the country’s need to increase the efficiency in the use of public resources. Still, the CPF focuses only on a selected set of activities, some driven by the portfolio, most increasingly driven by new lending and the knowledge program.

It outlines the institution building efforts carried out by the Palestinian authority prior to the 2000 crisis and the major development and reform initiatives since 2000. Hence, the study analyses the public sector reform, the approaches to trade and development, and the relationships with international donors. In particular, it focuses on the effectiveness and the distortive effect of international aid, evaluating possible alternative approaches. It suggests concentrating the allocation of international funds according to precise development objectives, focusing the rehabilitation of industries relatively labour intensive (such as agriculture). Moreover, sectors receiving aid should create employment opportunities sustainable in the long run, have strong backward and forward linkages, be strategically important for the economy and society at large, favour types of capital investment more resistant to destruction and with lower replacement costs, be able to foster exports or gain large domestic market share.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"04 Oct 2016","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2006-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"b540e63f-1a5b-4666-889c-a64cbd8dc132","title":"Solomon Islands Trade Policy Framework 2015","countryId":"c4945a2c-fd3e-48c5-9174-57592a6586fb","sectorIds":["cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","b5d69e19-00e5-4aa5-8f7b-84a1266df81f","0657d265-fab1-4e94-94ed-af6d88933f94","2403af10-fa09-4ba6-9d19-4b6bc0dfab33","2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950","b175ddc5-c657-4de6-90c7-de36e7c6bd14"],"year":"2015","description":"The formulation of Solomon Islands Trade Policy Framework began in 2013 and culminated with its endorsement by the Cabinet of Solomon Islands and the National Trade and Development Council in early 2015. Solomon Islanders have been trading across villages, provinces and indeed Melanesia for millennia. As an isolated archipelago nation, trade has helped us overcome inherent vulnerabilities and opened up new possibilities. In recent decades a more globalised world presents new challenges and opportunities for Solomon Islands. Our first Trade Policy Framework (TPF) describes the way forward as to how we will tackle these challenges and harness trade to achieve our development aims. With the application of the TPF we aspire for trade to promote human development, reduce poverty and improve living standards.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"27 Jul 2016","regionId":"604fdd0d-ccfb-4c2c-8676-8778e373f3c5","implementationPeriod":"2015-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"b948b40b-0a78-4643-9653-a65b8d4d4a64","title":"Turkmenistan; Country Partnership Strategy (2017-2021)","countryId":"ab807095-d0a9-403d-9fdc-d638f7fcc87b","sectorIds":["7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","3db025f5-434d-46a2-88e9-16aed5ee0ccc","0657d265-fab1-4e94-94ed-af6d88933f94"],"year":"2017","description":"The country partnership strategy (CPS), 2017– 2021 will help Turkmenistan become a key catalyst for regional cooperation and integration by diversifying its markets and repositioning the country as a trade and transit hub.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"01 Nov 2019","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2017-2021","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"d2e3cb1c-366c-4608-b5c4-a6627d1119d5","title":"NATIONAL AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT (AGOA) RESPONSE STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR ZAMBIA","countryId":"940df73e-bc90-40b2-a499-a1f8a7c53470","sectorIds":["cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","126ae1f3-932d-42ee-9ec4-44df17ef1189","a9205727-b4f1-4682-9911-3ca9449c9e09","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2"],"year":"2018","description":"This document outlines a response strategy to the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)\r\nwith a view to enhance Zambia’s exports into the U.S. and the regional market, in light of the\r\ncurrent low utilization levels of preferences under AGOA.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"07 Oct 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2018-2025","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"e78ace3c-015e-43fc-b2c9-a692f963551c","title":"Strategy for Agricultural Development","countryId":"9b682d13-e182-491d-9f21-62c028b9e0a3","sectorIds":["2403af10-fa09-4ba6-9d19-4b6bc0dfab33","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2"],"year":"2010","description":"The Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS) 2011-2020 is a long-term document which is meant to serve as a framework for the development of the sector, being implemented through the Agricultural Master Plan and the Agicultural Investment Plan.

Four specific goals have been set for the medium term (2011-2015): i) pursuing food security as the first priority in improving livelihoods; ii) increasing and modernizing production of agricultural commodities, thus establishing pro-poor and green value chains, based on smallholder farmers and targeting domestic, regional and global markets; iii) establishing sustainable production patterns in accordance to the specific conditions of each region, stabilizing shifting cultivations and taking measures for climate change adaptation; iv) improve forest management in order to ensure sustainability, preserve biodiversity and improve national forest cover.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"26 Aug 2016","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2011-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"449d9279-292b-4972-9734-a6a74e446941","title":"Kenya Apparel and Textile Industry : Diagnosis, Strategy and Action Plan","countryId":"b64cfacb-1236-448d-8608-814cfa62e683","sectorIds":["b55d80eb-92ac-425d-8957-73f53082cc28","a9205727-b4f1-4682-9911-3ca9449c9e09"],"year":"2015","description":"This strategy focuses on analysis of the Kenya’s textile and apparel sector aiming to analyze the competitiveness of the textile and apparel sectors in Kenya, to assess policy options,and recommend critical interventions to stimulate sector growth.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"19 Jul 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2015-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"90d7221f-0f44-48de-99b3-a6ce8de53618","title":"Reviving the Traditional Sectors and Preparing for the Future: an Export-Led Growth Strategy","countryId":"82ecfb01-ec22-4731-ae70-d172eb355b59","sectorIds":["451260a2-1f64-426b-af33-edfd0f7b261b","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","8dd6213c-935a-40f5-9096-a8be77969523","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","9ca4db08-e2d3-4070-b09c-a2eec5ee21d4","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","6a339fcc-f819-4056-8f05-9e3473191e06","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","8dd6213c-935a-40f5-9096-a8be77969523","d2694f12-97e2-4fd9-9187-f45a3f59a5c6","d2694f12-97e2-4fd9-9187-f45a3f59a5c6","e4d7cdb0-6692-47a1-8ca6-a6d787e4e12d","8fbb01a4-66cf-4700-a6bd-5dafb6486ce3","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","54db828e-c35c-41e0-a186-732b3eac4526","54db828e-c35c-41e0-a186-732b3eac4526","d2694f12-97e2-4fd9-9187-f45a3f59a5c6","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2"],"year":"2010","description":"The study provides an overview of the current situation of Tunisian economy, assessing its growth potential and the potential for export.

The new CSP 2017-2021 has drawn significant lessons from the implementation of the previous CSP 2011-2015, especially, the need for the Bank to invest in large projects that are aligned with the country’s economic transformation agenda to ensure sustainability and greater impact amid the spectrum of limited financial resources. The Bank’s new strategy in Angola seeks to assist the country to accelerate economic diversification and broaden the inclusive and sustainable growth base. Achieving this objective requires rapid agricultural transformation and value chains promotion for export diversification and job creation. Furthermore, there is a need to reduce the high logistical costs in the non-oil sector, improve skills while investing in technological innovation. In face of these challenges, the Bank is proposing a new strategy based on two complementary pillars (i) inclusive growth through agricultural transformation, and (ii) support to sustainable infrastructure development. The strategic goal is focused on the Angola’s “Vision 2025” objective of generating employment opportunities and further reduce poverty in line with the Bank’s High 5s.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"24 Jul 2017","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2017-2021","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"e2d1cf81-2417-40ad-9542-aafd6b3cd6d1","title":"National Development Plan 2010-2014","countryId":"85228aa1-da3a-4beb-8867-13a5131f17c6","sectorIds":["e4d7cdb0-6692-47a1-8ca6-a6d787e4e12d","93201d7b-686f-452d-9854-441ed3b04444","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","3ad501a8-09b7-4977-83a0-153cbb534326","4540795e-3705-4f40-9ef8-a136adf50a04","8dd6213c-935a-40f5-9096-a8be77969523","e4d7cdb0-6692-47a1-8ca6-a6d787e4e12d","13ab2e82-04d0-481e-b470-651a6742e089"],"year":"2010","description":"The National Development Plan aims at fostering economic growth, creating jobs, diversifying the economy, strengthening the role of the private sector, increasing productivity, reducing poverty, enhancing fair and homogenous spatial development, strengthening the role of local governments in sustaining development, and improving environmental sustainability.

Para materializar este propósito, el Comité Directivo de la NEPAD solicitó la asistencia técnica de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentación (FAO). En febrero de 2004, el Gobierno de Guinea Ecuatorial y la FAO firmaron un proyecto de cooperación técnica (Proyecto TCP/EQG/2904) para elaborar un plan nacional de inversión en agricultura y desarrollo rural, así como los perfiles de algunos proyectos de inversión vinculados al plan.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"02 Aug 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2005-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"74c6c443-4800-49d9-a3d1-ab21a00caa0a","title":"MOZAMBIQUE NATIONAL AGOA UTILIZATION STRATEGY","countryId":"691c1148-603a-40fa-b6c3-40b88452ad53","sectorIds":[],"year":"2018","description":"The Ministry of lndustry and Commerce highlights measures that encourage improvement of the knowledge and understanding of the AGOA and many actions that will contribute to an increase in exports considering this initiative. ln this strategy, the Ministry identifies sectors and products specific for exports, identifies capacity building actions, recommends in depth studies to attract more investments, and foresees massive dissemination actions for the benefit of interested parties.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"17 Jun 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2018-2023","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"762e7029-8985-468c-85ba-ab3db64e0547","title":"Towards European Integration (UA)","countryId":"cedb2c8f-a45d-4f4d-aaca-5b0fa5c1902e","sectorIds":["238929d7-5a32-483a-ad39-7611c3a879eb","513743dd-9ade-46a0-8c06-edc836671c6e","2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","724fa0de-e1f3-4597-968e-eddd6688a548","13ab2e82-04d0-481e-b470-651a6742e089"],"year":"2004","description":"The purpose of the Strategy of Economic and Social Development of Ukraine \"Towards European Integration\" (2004 - 2015) is to implement the strategic priorities for economic and social development aiming to achieve sustainable economic growth, promote an innovative model of development, re-orient economic policy to address social issues, and create the conditions for Ukraine\u0027s membership in the European Union.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"15 Aug 2016","regionId":"a9051429-6a0a-46de-ac0e-f3117cbe5c73","implementationPeriod":"2004-2015","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"496a53e7-fb60-4a13-b0be-ab5033b7b4e4","title":"Poverty Reduction Action Plan (2014)-Belize","countryId":"87fb4b19-1526-495c-b581-f6979038b217","sectorIds":[],"year":"2014","description":"The PRAP is used to influence the country‟s priorities for poverty reduction with BNTF\r\nresources.

In order to achieve the goals of the strategy, the following activities have been plannes: law on trade regulation, systematization of the legal basis for trade, creation of regional and municipal programmes for trade development in Russia, development of public-private partnership in the area of education, development of infrastructure for small business as well as monitoring of competition levels.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"04 Oct 2016","regionId":"a9051429-6a0a-46de-ac0e-f3117cbe5c73","implementationPeriod":"2010-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"edadd3b5-b956-4aa3-90ce-b04ed4949d1c","title":"WHO Country Cooperation Strategy for Marshall Islands 2013-2017","countryId":"bb95b65e-b958-474a-aff7-00fa5b87171b","sectorIds":["546c1bbd-5d05-4805-a720-ea197c91ef1a"],"year":"2012","description":"This document is part of the WHO Multi-Country Cooperation Strategy for the Pacific 2013–2017 (MCCS) that has been developed by the governments of the countries and territories in the Pacific and the World Health Organization\r\n(WHO) through a consultative process with the United Nations system and key development partners.\r\nThe strategy identifies health and development challenges and priorities in the Pacific and establishes an overall strategic direction and approach for overcoming the challenges and achieving national goals.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"06 Aug 2016","regionId":"604fdd0d-ccfb-4c2c-8676-8778e373f3c5","implementationPeriod":"2013-2017","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"a2f55245-ac6d-432f-a393-b05e9f729d9b","title":"Argentina; Plan Federal Estrategico de Turismo Sustentable 2020","countryId":"989ffd50-ddad-4377-9f38-594851db4007","sectorIds":["2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950"],"year":"2011","description":"The purpose of this strategy is to mobilize resources and investments to create a sustainable and inclusive tourism sector in Argentina.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"30 Oct 2019","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2012-2025","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"218ca183-47a1-45e8-a80e-b0b68cb0f4eb","title":"People\u0027s Republic of China: Country Partnership Strategy (2011-2015)","countryId":"0dd83c77-6d72-4705-9d3d-41c3dd29e805","sectorIds":["3db025f5-434d-46a2-88e9-16aed5ee0ccc","8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505","5bdc38de-2f19-40b6-a4de-f228163cc6a6","7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","f701fac4-6f12-4f1e-8a39-899ca3ec91b0","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2"],"year":"2012","description":"This Country Partnership Strategy for the People\u0027s Republic of China defines ADB\u0027s strategic approach in the country for 2011–2015.

The CPS 2011-2015 seeks to adapt to the PRC’s rapidly changing circumstances and set a new foundation for the continuously evolving ADB-PRC partnership. Three decades of successful reforms have transformed the PRC into the world’s second largest economy and facilitated a swift transition from a low-income to middle-income country. In line with its growing economic strength and international status, the PRC has come to play an increasing role in promoting global public goods, sharing knowledge, and providing development assistance both bilaterally as well as through multilateral finance institutions. As such, the PRC has contributed to the Asian Development Fund and established an ADB-administered trust fund for regional cooperation and poverty reduction. However, the PRC still faces complex development challenges, including significant poverty, rising income inequality, and widening regional disparities. The new CPS therefore seeks to position ADB to continue playing a catalytic role in the PRC’s development process through an enhanced operational focus on innovation and value addition and a further shift toward generating knowledge, sharing best practices, building capacity, and fostering regional cooperation.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"08 Aug 2017","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2011-2015","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"2ae6b435-c1cc-4fb9-af9e-b1425193277f","title":"UNDAF Swaziland (2016-2020)","countryId":"947c1d0d-fd49-49ac-8d71-857037f470b9","sectorIds":["5bdc38de-2f19-40b6-a4de-f228163cc6a6","8aea549e-4caf-4388-ad6c-f6b4d58fd505","546c1bbd-5d05-4805-a720-ea197c91ef1a","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","f701fac4-6f12-4f1e-8a39-899ca3ec91b0"],"year":"2016","description":"This UNDAF sets new aspirations for more effective and efficient delivery that will support in fasttracking Swaziland’s development objectives.

It is one of the pillars of “Make in India” and “Digital India” programs of the Government. However, there has been a gap between the achievement and the potential of this sector. Being the premier policy think tank of the Indian government, the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) has prepared a Strategy Paper for Make in India in Electronics. This paper lays down India’s policy options for electronics hardware industry and argues in favor of an export-oriented strategy. The essential argument made is that at less than $65 billion, the domestic market remains small in relation to the world market, which is in excess of $2 trillion. Going for the larger market as China has done would permit the exploitation of economies of scale and agglomeration and help the industry become globally competitive. The alternative import – substitution strategy would gain competitiveness principally in the domestic market since it largely relies on securing the domestic market for domestic producers.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"16 May 2017","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2016-","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"42b5343e-870e-4a77-8cd9-b6eb3442c741","title":"A South African Trade Policy and Strategy Framework","countryId":"ec06d616-e161-49cf-b6d6-211a3ee491f3","sectorIds":[],"year":"2010","description":"The TPSF contributes to achieve the objectives of upgrading and diversifying South African economy, in allignment with th National Industrial Policy Framework.

Key priority is to obtain the recognition of the State of Palestine as a sovereign and independent country within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as capital. The Palestinian National Authority also aims to improve public governance, the judicial system and the delivery of services such as education, health and social protection; enhance economic growth especially through an increase in trade with neighbours and an improvement in business environment. Infrastructures will also be restored and potentiated, also with the creation of a territorial link between Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The government will also foster economic growth and stability ensuring the sustainability of public finances and creative a more conducive economic and institutional environment. The implementation of the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) in 2008-2010 allowed to increase public revenues and to decrease expenditures, improving overall efficiency of public administration. The government plans on progressively reducing reliance of external aid in the future, relying on higher economic growth and improved revenue administration. The plan also allocates expenditures for the 2011-2013 period among four major policy sectors: governance, social, economy, infrastructure. It also identifies the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip as the single biggest challenge for the same period. Finally, the NDP provides for increasing transparency, monitoring the performance of public administration, enhancing private-public partnerships, and improving accountability and oversight of public officers as well as of the private sector.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"04 Oct 2016","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2011-2013","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"cd8fa3fb-9fd2-4646-97b4-bb6582f53846","title":"Plan Cadre Intégré des Nations Unies pour l’aide au développement Mali (2015-2019)","countryId":"6e2c37c0-9e1c-4d06-9745-d84289ece978","sectorIds":[],"year":"2015","description":"Le présent Plan Cadre intégré des Nations Unies pour l’aide au développement (UNDAF+) couvre la période 2015 – 2019 et constitue la base de référence pour les interventions des Nations Unies composées au Mali de la Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation au Mali (MINUSMA) des fonds, des programmes et des institutions spécialisés des Nations Unies.

Three priorities stand out in this paper: Increasing meat supplies, modernizing industry infrastructure, and improving access to domestic and foreign markets.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"26 Sep 2016","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2012-2017","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"eeb6a926-42f5-445a-9ca1-bc45c11d2693","title":"Argentina; IDB Group Country Strategy (2016-2019)","countryId":"989ffd50-ddad-4377-9f38-594851db4007","sectorIds":["086469e1-0de1-4c50-859c-c13add56ee83","5bdc38de-2f19-40b6-a4de-f228163cc6a6","34f1f47e-53e5-4dec-bb27-cb36e5b8ad0f","a6497fa4-2efa-4973-a45d-09526ecb9f25","7f21856c-6ff6-4ffa-9796-0082549bd11f","3db025f5-434d-46a2-88e9-16aed5ee0ccc"],"year":"2016","description":"The country strategy with Argentina for the 2016–2019 period will help to redirect the economy, with the private sector becoming the main driver of economic development and leading to faster growth, greater job creation, and reduced social inequalities. The IDB Group intends to work on three strategic priorities that will inform both sovereign-guaranteed and non-sovereign guaranteed interventions: (i) business climate improvement; (ii) strengthening of private-sector integration and insertion into value chains; and (iii) poverty and inequality reduction. While the country strategy will support a considerable number of interventions at the national level and will provide overall support to help improve the quality of public management at the provincial level, interventions will continue to focus on Norte Grande and the Buenos Aires conurbation, where income and sector development gaps continue to be significant. The Belgrano Plan will be supported by developing infrastructure and access to basic services, as well as by reducing poverty in the Norte Grande region. In the Buenos Aires conurbation, the strategy will support the components of the Pobreza Cero [Zero Poverty] plan, particularly interventions in early childhood development and improvement of water and sanitation services.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"14 Nov 2019","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2016-2019","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"a430dba6-237c-4e27-9409-bc6422f4570b","title":"Country Strategy Paper (2013-2017): Lesotho","countryId":"b9b32958-3621-44e1-a63b-e3fbcb1f6e38","sectorIds":[],"year":"2013","description":"The paper proposes a new Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for the Kingdom of Lesotho for the period 2013-2017.

While fundamental development conditions and priorities in Senegal have not changed, Senegal has seen an improved enabling environment, evidenced by broader commitment to private sector-led growth, improved transparency and accountability, and quality Senegalese leadership in key sectors of USAID intervention. In addition, this Update incorporates new Agency initiatives and strategies, such as YALI, Global Health Security, Education, and Global Climate Change. The CDCS Update describes how USAID/Senegal programs focus on the poorest, highest need regions of Senegal, such as the marginalized southern Casamance region and the remote eastern corridor of the country. USAID/Senegal has increased its efforts to promote synergy across its sectors of intervention in targeted regions, in addition to integrated good governance principles across the entire foreign assistance portfolio.

Given the short timeframe of the strategy and the different degrees of development which characterize each stage of the value chain, the document suggests to follow a differentiated strategy, focusing all domestic investments on the clothing sector (already well-developed) and relying on foreign investments to improve fibre production and processing. Hence, the fundamental recommendations for the fibre production and processing industry are: i) to evaluate whether to rehabilitate some of the major former state-owned enterprises focused on specific products or to liquidate them; ii) to establish active programmes in order to attract foreign strategic partners, in particular in spinning; iii) to support programmes for medium-size private enterprises having a clear business plan; iv) to support public and private institutions (education and association); v) to support know-how transfer of technology, productivity improvement, processing management and product development trough Private-Public Partnerships projects.

Ethiopia’s current model has performed well, yielding strong economic and social returns. Even so, performance has fallen short of the sector’s targets and it has become clear that the industry must unite and evolve in order to leapfrog into higher growth and value addition.The sector’s strategic orientation should follow a twofold approach. Firstly, Ethiopia can build on its current success and leverage its cost competitiveness to expand market diversification and penetration. Secondly, the sector can capture greater value by pursuing full value chain integration, first by bridging the skill gap to increase productivity, especially considering upcoming wage increases, and later by enhancing weak upstream capacities. The Plan of Action responds to this vision by setting four strategic objectives to support its implementation. 1) Improve productivity and employment outcomes through skills development. 2) Strengthen the enabling environment to favour sector development. 3) Establish conditions to harness foreign direct investment (FDI) as an engine for growth in T \u0026 C. 4) Foster product and market development through the use of trade information. 5) Enable market penetration and product development through trade intelligence.","typeId":"e0c2b847-ffc5-421f-a0aa-4a2f90ad8408","lastUpdate":"07 Oct 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2016-2020","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"a4df6b02-682b-4674-a616-cb72925a5fe9","title":"Stratégie de Relance du Développement et de Réduction de la Pauvreté","countryId":"4da70af7-c5c2-4320-80f1-a165aed3be7e","sectorIds":["d2694f12-97e2-4fd9-9187-f45a3f59a5c6","54db828e-c35c-41e0-a186-732b3eac4526","d2694f12-97e2-4fd9-9187-f45a3f59a5c6","4e869a4e-ec69-4624-a1ce-11c2b7927067","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","a2d73f4f-b6e5-471b-9380-cc06a61ad018","b2e2073b-280c-418c-b7d3-249b71d76eef","8dd6213c-935a-40f5-9096-a8be77969523","1a4188d3-ca4e-468a-9077-69ab2b7b25de","703953f5-d1ef-4cfb-a377-42282a87a49c","cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2"],"year":"2009","description":"The documents first provides an overview of the current economic and social situation in Côte d\u0027Ivoire, with a per-sector diagnosis and a focus on issues related to poverty and hunger.

These objectives are to be realized in two phases: a period of economic recovery in 2012-2013 and a period of stimulation with growth rates rising to above 7% in 2017.

The PRSp was prepared by means of a new approach—through a wide consultative process ensuring the inclusion of all stakeholders to which the PRSp refers. Bringing together these participants in the process of preparing the PRS gave the Strategy legitimacy, resulting in the adoption of the document by the newly elected Government of the Republic of Serbia, which overtook the responsibility for its implementation. The PRS is a multi-sector strategy that serves as a basis for developing and integrating new and existing programmatic documents within different social sectors, i.e. the fields of work of the line ministries and other government institutions. The areas of employment, education, health care and social welfare have been identified as key priorities of the PRS implementation in 2004 and 2005. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for Serbia and its implementation complement the efforts of the Republic of Serbia in the European Union integration process.","typeId":"f783f867-7cac-46e4-83d4-f2a50774d984","lastUpdate":"25 Jul 2016","regionId":"a9051429-6a0a-46de-ac0e-f3117cbe5c73","implementationPeriod":"2005-2010","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"4559046e-666c-48a7-a5a2-d5ddac86c5ac","title":"Cadre de Politique Commerciale: Algérie","countryId":"38837eef-de83-4d76-9bea-5adadc54ddb6","sectorIds":[],"year":"2017","description":"Le but de cette étude est de préparer un document qui définit les contours d\u0027un nouveau cadre de politique commerciale qui soit à même de répondre aux exigences de modernité et de diversification de l\u0027économie et de relever les multiples défis que pose le système commercial international dans ses dimensions, bilatérale, régionale\r\net multilatérale.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"16 Oct 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2017-2021","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"127fafe9-f325-4142-9f17-d6027f0db252","title":"National Dairy Strategy","countryId":"3a04839a-890e-4d7b-bad4-40f29b2b9d3c","sectorIds":["4e869a4e-ec69-4624-a1ce-11c2b7927067","4e869a4e-ec69-4624-a1ce-11c2b7927067"],"year":"2013","description":"Rwanda\u0027s National Dairy Strategy outlines how calculated investment in the diary supply chain of Rwanda can provide a path out of poverty for its people.

Today’s head of state, Alpha Condé, became Guinea’s first democratically-elected president in 2010, beginning a democratic transition that the United States continues to support, but which still lacks the institutional basis for sustainability. The key transition required is not only that of dictators to democrats, but also from individual rule to institutional rule. There is a legacy of misrule by unaccountable individuals acting without institutional oversight. There is also a legacy of catastrophic policy choices that have impoverished Guinea, a country with a strong commercial tradition and a rich endowment of agricultural, water and mineral resources.

This means that women have less representation and less education and comprise a smaller portion of the workforce.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"19 Nov 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2019-2024","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"3212a309-8c09-4831-b11d-dcc0029d534b","title":"Lebanon Ministry of Agriculture 2015–2019 Strategy","countryId":"69e0ac35-eca3-46b4-9e94-b5582d55a838","sectorIds":["cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2"],"year":"2014","description":"Under the framework of the EU funded Agriculture and Rural Development Programme (ARDP), Ministry of Agriculture Strategy describes the current agricultural policies and offers the strategic plan for the Ministry of Agriculture for the next five years.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"14 Jul 2016","regionId":"1a7644bb-7cab-48d6-be14-a08a987bb394","implementationPeriod":"2015-2019","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"b9e06121-fc47-4ad5-a281-dce1176a27e8","title":"Trade Policy Framework: Zambia - Harnessing the Potential for Trade and Sustainable Growth in Zambia","countryId":"940df73e-bc90-40b2-a499-a1f8a7c53470","sectorIds":[],"year":"2016","description":"Trade policy is important to enable Zambia to sustain and reduce risks to the current growth process.

In general terms, it will contribute to the objective of “support for small and vulnerable countries” (Groups C and D). There are opportunities in the water and sanitation, social protection, education and job training, and urban development and security sectors for operations that will contribute to the objective of “poverty reduction and equity enhancement,” while the energy and agribusiness sectors will contribute to the objective of “climate change, sustainable energy, and environmental sustainability” and “regional cooperation and integration.” The energy, services export, agribusiness, and transport sectors will also contribute to the latter objective.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"02 Aug 2016","regionId":"3f5ceef1-92b1-4378-b9d9-8b6486154219","implementationPeriod":"2010-2015","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"f10f4d5a-3457-43d3-a891-ecbfb5fcedfc","title":"National Medium-Term Development Plan (2010-2014)","countryId":"abf04d10-a52f-41e7-8346-bbe198b9e92d","sectorIds":[],"year":"2010","description":"The National Medium-Term Development Plan (2010-2014) is composed of three books.

The threat of famine has not been completely removed, but enough progress has beenmade so that USAID can now focusmore on helping Ethiopia transform its economy and society toward middle income status, and by coordinating its efforts more closely with the Government of Ethiopia (GOE), other donors and civil society.","typeId":"2faaa754-89be-46f2-8468-e15cb7924d28","lastUpdate":"18 Nov 2019","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2011-2019","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b","b003b72a-0d78-45df-87a1-2522eeb4dd92"]},{"id":"367101ed-800d-471d-83d8-f0798be7fc96","title":"Mid-Term Development Strategy of Bosnia and Herzegovina (PRSP) (2004-2007)","countryId":"4c508907-e87d-48d1-8e2d-e7f52f5dd4db","sectorIds":["cc357bb6-86d8-437b-b8a8-4e239418b8d2","2c026ad7-1eb3-4be0-8c0b-d09c80903950","b175ddc5-c657-4de6-90c7-de36e7c6bd14","2403af10-fa09-4ba6-9d19-4b6bc0dfab33","6a339fcc-f819-4056-8f05-9e3473191e06","126ae1f3-932d-42ee-9ec4-44df17ef1189"],"year":"2004","description":"The government structures at all levels led the preparation of the BiH Medium-Term Development\r\nStrategy.

A subsidiary effort is also underway to prepare a Zanzibar Export Development Strategy, coordinated by the Zanzibar Ministry of Tourism, Trade and Investment. Exporting is potentially a very powerful means of raising incomes, generating employment and reducing poverty. Sustained growth in export earnings is most effectively achieved where both the public and private sectors agree to coordinate activities around a prioritised and ambitious, but realistic, export development strategy. Over recent years, Tanzania’s export performance, despite respectable growth, has performed below expectations. Hence, the aim of the Tanzania National Export Strategy is to critically assess recent export performance and trends, highlight obstacles to increased export competitiveness, establish priorities for the years ahead, and form a partnership between the public and private sectors aimed at realising the goal of accelerating Tanzania’s export performance.","typeId":"1284f11c-beee-49f3-91ff-95d42691fa1f","lastUpdate":"23 Aug 2017","regionId":"d380856d-ddca-4995-9cc5-51179abc00f6","implementationPeriod":"2010-2014","thematicFocus":["41a328a2-b698-4b2d-9ef4-09775ca959f1","f0d58caa-196e-4f43-bfda-c33d4366221a","1b28a4b2-73ef-4f52-82c7-dfe9935b48c1","dd9152b3-b4ad-44b4-8662-4fc1a32ed1b7","9b26e5d5-a4e7-4160-8674-0bcaaf5809b0","de0cd883-9619-44df-871d-af45b413d6ec","ab372fc0-e5ce-4651-8b3b-4c3d2a516379","98c45a41-b35e-4c3e-9dc3-d1135f8110f6","ab0dabb7-b80d-4583-a912-464cd3e5f044","d0022894-b05c-4b33-9fb1-604ba9c0a239","8cad5278-6a81-4335-9e1f-7bad22c5468f","7bd3df25-282a-4063-80e1-53b9a4bbec36","a3129fd3-ddbe-4b77-96bc-d1add7106bc5","f1ea83c3-191a-4f77-a12a-02c48a4fb254","18b9253d-fba6-4c01-83a5-169c41df508b"]},{"id":"77c51c04-a786-479b-95e6-f32366ee9c38","title":"UNDAF Peru (2012-2016)","countryId":"69ad7c10-405f-4b45-a3ee-fa1a1b21e473","sectorIds":[],"year":"2011","description":"The UNDAF is alligned with the objectives expressed by the MDGs and the national vision \"El Peru hacia el 2012\".

Second, the CPF will support the development of human capital.

Other principles include the need for selectivity, critical mass and continuity in chosen sectors; flexibility; a combination of finance and knowledge products; and the blending of public and private sector assistance. The resulting CPS responds to the objectives of the government\u0027s NDS and ADB\u0027s Strategy 2020. The CPS sets out a roadmap to anchor phased physical and non-physical investments to improve connectivity, energy security and private sector development.
