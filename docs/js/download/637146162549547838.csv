This strategy aims to enable the private sector to lead Afghanistan’s development and poverty reduction by building on a market– based system, driven by private sector growth, in which Government is the policy maker and regulator of the economy. To realize this vision, this plan outlines the following initiatives: strengthen the enabling environment for the private sector and mobilize private investment, both domestic and foreign;  privatize state owned enterprises (SOEs);  provide incentives to encourage firms to formalize their operations; and expand access to regional and international markets.
